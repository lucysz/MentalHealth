Estimated and measured intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the ejaculatory latency is of short duration; therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for diagnostic purposes(Segraves 2010). A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in heterosexual men. There are insufficient data to determine if this duration criterion can be applied to acquired premature (early) ejaculation. The durational definition may apply to males of varying sexual orientations, since ejaculatory latencies appear to be similar across men of different sexual orientations and across different sexual activities(Jern et al. 2010).', '', 'Many males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over ejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to delay ejaculation on future sexual encounters(Althof 2006).', '', 'The following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), and stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.', 'Estimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely depending on the definition utilized. Internationally, more than 20%–30% of men ages 18–70 years report concern about how rapidly they ejaculate(Laumann et al. 2005). With the new definition of premature (early) ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation occurring within approximately 1 minute of vaginal penetration), only 1%–3% of men would be diagnosed with the disorder. Prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation may increase with age.By definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a male’s initial sexual experiences and persists thereafter. Some men may experience premature (early) ejaculation during their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persistence of ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation. In contrast, some men develop the disorder after a period of having a normal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature (early) ejaculation. There is far less known about acquired premature (early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature (early) ejaculation. The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or after the fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable throughout life. Little is known about the course of acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Reversal of medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and prostatitis appears to restore ejaculatory latencies to baseline values(Rowland et al. 2010). Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and persists throughout an individual’s life. In approximately 20% of men with premature (early) ejaculation, ejaculatory latencies decrease further with age. Age and relationship length have been found to be negatively associated with prevalence of premature (early) ejaculationPremature (early) ejaculation may be more common in men with anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia).There is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature (early) ejaculation (Jern et al. 2007). Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with dopamine transporter gene polymorphism(Santtila et al. 2010) or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism(Waldinger 2011). Thyroid disease, prostatitis, and drug withdrawal are associated with acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Positron emission tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow during ejaculation have shown primary activation in the mesocephalic transition zone, including the ventral tegmental area.Perception of what constitutes a normal ejaculatory latency is different in many cultures. Measured ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries(Waldinger et al. 2005). Such differences may be explained by cultural or religious factors as well as genetic differences between populations.Premature (early) ejaculation is a sexual disorder in males. Males and their sexual partners may differ in their perception of what constitutes an acceptable ejaculatory latency. There may be increasing concerns in females about early ejaculation in their sexual partners, which may be a reflection of changing societal attitudes concerning female sexual activity. Ejaculatory latency is usually monitored in research settings by the sexual partner utilizing a timing device (e.g., stopwatch), though this is not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For vaginal intercourse, the time between intravaginal penetration and ejaculation is measured. A pattern of premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with decreased self-esteem, a sense of lack of control, and adverse consequences for partner relationships. It may also cause personal distress in the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction in the sexual partner(Rosen and Althof 2008). Ejaculation prior to penetration may be associated with difficulties in conception.', 'Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction', '', 'When problems with premature ejaculation are due exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal, substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed.', 'Ejaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria', '', 'It is necessary to identify males with normal ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory latencies and males who have episodic premature (early) ejaculation (e.g., during the first sexual encounter with a new partner when a short ejaculatory latency may be common or normative). Neither of these situations would lead to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though these situations may be distressing to some males(Waldinger and Schweitzer 2006).', 'Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with erectile problems. In many cases, it may be difficult to determine which difficulty preceded the other. Lifelong premature ( early) ejaculation may be associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature ( early) ejaculation may be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug withdrawal (e.g., during opioid withdrawal).', '', '']
