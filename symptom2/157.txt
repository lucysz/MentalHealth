Volatile hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and other volatile compounds. When possible, the particular substance involved should be named (e.g., “toluene use disorder”). However, most compounds that are inhaled are a mixture of several substances that can produce psychoactive effects, and it is often difficult to ascertain the exact substance responsible for the disorder. Unless there is clear evidence that a single, unmixed substance has been used, the general term inhalant should be used in recording the diagnosis. Disorders arising from inhalation of nitrous oxide or of amyl-, butyl-, or isobutylnitrite are considered as other (or unknown) substance use disorder.', '', '“In a controlled environment” applies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.', '', 'The severity of individuals’ inhalant use disorder is assessed by the number of diagnostic criteria endorsed. Changing severity of individuals’ inhalant use disorder across time is reflected by reductions in the frequency (e.g., days used per month) and/or dose (e.g., tubes of glue per day) used, as assessed by the individual’s self-report, report of others, clinician’s observations, and biological testing (when practical).', '', 'Features of inhalant use disorder include repeated use of an inhalant substance despite the individual’s knowing that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual (Criterion A9). Those problems are reflected in the diagnostic criteria.', '', 'Missing work or school or inability to perform typical responsibilities at work or school (Criterion A5), and continued use of the inhalant substance even though it causes arguments with family or friends, fights, and other social or interpersonal problems (Criterion A6), may be seen in inhalant use disorder. Limiting family contact, work or school obligations, or recreational activities (e.g., sports, games, hobbies) may also occur (Criterion A7). Use of inhalants when driving or operating dangerous equipment (Criterion A8) is also seen.', '', 'Tolerance (Criterion A10) and mild withdrawal are each reported by about 10% of individuals who use inhalants, and a few individuals use inhalants to avoid withdrawal(Ridenour et al. 2007). However, because the withdrawal symptoms are mild(Miyata et al. 2004), this manual neither recognizes a diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal nor counts withdrawal complaints as a diagnostic criterion for inhalant use disorder.', 'A diagnosis of inhalant use disorder is supported by recurring episodes of intoxication with negative results in standard drug screens (which do not detect inhalants); possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant substances; peri-oral or peri-nasal “glue-sniffer’s rash”; association with other individuals known to use inhalants; membership in groups with prevalent inhalant use (e.g., some native or aboriginal communities, homeless children in street gangs); easy access to certain inhalant substances; paraphernalia possession; presence of the disorder’s characteristic medical complications (e.g., brain white matter pathology, rhabdomyolysis); and the presence of multiple substance use disorders(Wu et al. 2008). Inhalant use and inhalant use disorder are associated with past suicide attempts, especially among adults reporting previous episodes of low mood or anhedonia(Botnick et al. 2002; Howard et al. 2010).About 0.4% of Americans ages 12–17 years have a pattern of use that meets criteria for inhalant use disorder in the past 12 months(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2010). Among those youths, the prevalence is highest in Native Americans and lowest in African Americans. Prevalence falls to about 0.1% among Americans ages 18–29 years, and only 0.02% when all Americans 18 years or older are considered, with almost no females and a preponderance of European Americans. Of course, in isolated subgroups, prevalence may differ considerably from these overall rates.', '', 'About 10% of 13-year-old American children report having used inhalants at least once; that percentage remains stable through age 17 years(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2008). Among those 12- to 17-year-olds who use inhalants, the more-used substances include glue, shoe polish, or toluene; gasoline or lighter fluid; or spray paints(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2010).', '', 'Only 0.4% of 12- to 17-year-olds progress to inhalant use disorder; those youths tend to exhibit multiple other problems(Wu et al. 2004). The declining prevalence of inhalant use disorder after adolescence indicates that this disorder usually remits in early adulthood.', '', 'Volatile hydrocarbon use disorder is rare in prepubertal children, most common in adolescents and young adults, and uncommon in older persons. Calls to poison-control centers for “intentional abuse” of inhalants peak with calls involving individuals at age 14 years(Marsolek et al. 2010). Of adolescents who use inhalants, perhaps one-fifth develop inhalant use disorder (Perron et al. 2009); a few die from inhalant-related accidents, or “sudden sniffing death”(Pfeiffer et al. 2006). But the disorder apparently remits in many individuals after adolescence. Prevalence declines dramatically among individuals in their 20s. Those with inhalant use disorder extending into adulthood often have severe problems: substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and suicidal ideation with attempts(Howard et al. 2010).', 'Predictors of progression from nonuse of inhalants, to use, to inhalant use disorder include comorbid non-inhalant substance use disorders and either conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Other predictors are earlier onset of inhalant use and prior use of mental health services(Compton et al. 2005; Howard et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2004). Inhalant gases are widely and legally available, increasing the risk of misuse. Childhood maltreatment or trauma also is associated with youthful progression from inhalant non-use to inhalant use disorder (Perron and Howard 2009). Behavioral disinhibition is a highly heritable general propensity to not constrain behavior in socially acceptable ways, to break social norms and rules, and to take dangerous risks, pursuing rewards excessively despite dangers of adverse consequences. Youths with strong behavioral disinhibition show risk factors for inhalant use disorder: early-onset substance use disorder, multiple substance involvement, and early conduct problems(Iacono et al. 2008). Because behavioral disinhibition is under strong genetic influence, youths in families with substance and antisocial problems are at elevated risk for inhalant use disorder (Perron et al. 2009).Certain native or aboriginal communities have experienced a high prevalence of inhalant problems(Cairney and Dingwall 2010; Mitchell et al. 2003). Also, in some countries, groups of homeless children in street gangs have extensive inhalant use problems(Seth et al. 2005).Although the prevalence of inhalant use disorder is almost identical in adolescent males and females, the disorder is very rare among adult females.Urine, breath, or saliva tests may be valuable for assessing concurrent use of non-inhalant substances by individuals with inhalant use disorder. However, technical problems and the considerable expense of analyses make frequent biological testing for inhalants themselves impractical(Sakai and Crowley 2009).', '', 'Because of inherent toxicity, use of butane or propane is not infrequently fatal(Marsolek et al. 2010). Moreover, any inhaled volatile hydrocarbons may produce “sudden sniffing death” from cardiac arrhythmia(Sakai and Crowley 2009). Fatalities may occur even on the first inhalant exposure and are not thought to be dose-related. Volatile hydrocarbon use impairs neurobehavioral function and causes various neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary problems(Sakai and Crowley 2009).', '', 'Long-term inhalant users are at increased risk for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, depression, anxiety, bronchitis, asthma, and sinusitis(Han et al. 2010). Deaths may occur from respiratory depression, arrhythmias, asphyxiation, aspiration of vomitus, or accident and injury(Sakai and Crowley 2009).', 'Inhalant exposure (unintentional) from industrial or other accidents', '', 'This designation is used when findings suggest repeated or continuous inhalant exposure but the involved individual and other informants deny any history of purposeful inhalant use.', 'Inhalant use (intentional), without meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder', '', 'Inhalant use is common among adolescents, but for most of those individuals, the inhalant use does not meet the diagnostic standard of two or more Criterion A items for inhalant use disorder in the past year.', 'Inhalant intoxication, without meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder', '', 'Inhalant intoxication occurs frequently during inhalant use disorder but also may occur among individuals whose use does not meet criteria for inhalant use disorder, which requires at least two of the 10 diagnostic criteria in the past year.', 'Inhalant-induced disorders (i.e., inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, neurocognitive disorder, other inhalant-induced disorders) without meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder', '', 'Criteria are met for a psychotic, depressive, anxiety, or major neurocognitive disorder, and there is evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the deficits are etiologically related to the effects of inhalant substances. Yet, criteria for inhalant use disorder may not be met (i.e., fewer than 2 of the 10 criteria were present).', 'Other substance use disorders, especially those involving sedating substances (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates)', '', 'Inhalant use disorder commonly co-occurs with other substance use disorders, and the symptoms of the disorders may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when some of the substances were not being used.', 'Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders impairing central or peripheral nervous system function', '', 'Individuals with inhalant use disorder may present with symptoms of pernicious anemia, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, psychosis, major or minor cognitive disorder, brain atrophy, leukoencephalopathy, and many other nervous system disorders(Sakai and Crowley 2009). Of course, these disorders also may occur in the absence of inhalant use disorder. A history of little or no inhalant use helps to exclude inhalant use disorder as the source of these problems.', 'Disorders of other organ systems', '', 'Individuals with inhalant use disorder may present with symptoms of hepatic or renal damage, rhabdomyolysis, methemoglobinemia, or symptoms of other gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or pulmonary diseases(Sakai and Crowley 2009). A history of little or no inhalant use helps to exclude inhalant use disorder as the source of such medical problems.', 'Individuals with inhalant use disorder receiving clinical care often have numerous other substance use disorders (Wu et al. 2008). Inhalant use disorder commonly co-occurs with adolescent conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder. Adult inhalant use and inhalant use disorder also are strongly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts(Howard et al. 2010).', '', '']
