['Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions', 'A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present.', 'Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition in one of the following ways:', 'The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a close temporal association between the psychological factors and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition.', 'The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adherence).', 'The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual.', 'The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology, precipitating or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medical attention.', 'The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder).', 'Specify current severity:', 'Mild: Increases medical risk (e.g., inconsistent adherence with antihypertension treatment).', 'Moderate: Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating asthma).', 'Severe: Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room visit.', 'Extreme: Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring heart attack symptoms).', 'The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is the presence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability (Criterion B). These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its course or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by influencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate medical attention.', 'Psychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress, patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive health behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adherence to medical recommendations. Common clinical examples are anxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and manipulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes wishing to lose weight. Many different psychological factors have been demonstrated to adversely influence medical conditions—for example, symptoms of depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship style, personality traits, and coping styles(Ciechanowski et al. 2010; Katon et al. 2007; Kirmayer and Looper 2006; Leserman 2008). The adverse effects can range from acute, with immediate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy)(Akashi et al. 2010) to chronic, occurring over a long period of time (e.g., chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension)(Rosenthal and Alter 2012). Affected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g., diabetes, cancer, coronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g., migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia), or idiopathic medical symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness)(Levenson 2008; Stoudemire 1995).', 'This diagnosis should be reserved for situations in which the effect of the psychological factor on the medical condition is evident and the psychological factor has clinically significant effects on the course or outcome of the medical condition. Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor). There must be reasonable evidence to suggest an association between the psychological factors and the medical condition, although it may often not be possible to demonstrate direct causality or the mechanisms underlying the relationship.', 'The essential feature of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is the presence of one or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, death, or disability (Criterion B).
