Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. The phencyclidines (or phencyclidine-like substances) include phencyclidine (e.g., PCP, “angel dust”) and less potent but similarly acting compounds such as ketamine, cyclohexamine, and dizocilpine. These substances were first developed as dissociative anesthetics in the 1950s and became street drugs in the 1960s. They produce feelings of separation from mind and body (hence “dissociative”) in low doses, and at high doses, stupor and coma can result. These substances are most commonly smoked or taken orally, but they may also be snorted or injected. Although the primary psychoactive effects of PCP last for a few hours, the total elimination rate of this drug from the body typically extends 8 days or longer. The hallucinogenic effects in vulnerable individuals may last for weeks and may precipitate a persistent psychotic episode resembling schizophrenia(Luscher 2009). Ketamine has been observed to have utility in the treatment of major depressive disorder(Aan Het Rot et al. 2012). Withdrawal symptoms have not been clearly established in humans, and therefore the withdrawal criterion is not included in the diagnosis of phencyclidine use disorder. Phencyclidine may be detected in urine for up to 8 days or even longer at very high doses(Martin 2008). In addition to laboratory tests to detect its presence, characteristic symptoms resulting from intoxication with phencyclidine or related substances may aid in its diagnosis. Phencyclidine is likely to produce dissociative symptoms, analgesia, nystagmus, and hypertension, with risk of hypotension and shock. Violent behavior can also occur with phencyclidine use, as intoxicated persons may believe that they are being attacked. Residual symptoms following use may resemble schizophrenia. The prevalence of phencyclidine use disorder is unknown. Approximately 2.5% of the population reports having ever used phencyclidine. The proportion of users increases with age, from 0.3% of 12- to 17-year-olds, to 1.3% of 18- to 25-year-olds, to 2.9% of those age 26 years and older reporting ever using phencyclidine(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2012). There appears to have been an increase among 12th graders in both ever used (to 2.3% from 1.8%) and past-year use (to 1.3% from 1.0%) of phencyclidine(Johnson et al. 2012). Past-year use of ketamine appears relatively stable among 12th graders (1.6%–1.7% over the past 3 years).There is little information about risk factors for phencyclidine use disorder. Among individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment, those for whom phencyclidine was the primary substance were younger than those admitted for other substance use, had lower educational levels, and were more likely to be located in the West and Northeast regions of the United States, compared with other admissions(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2004).', 'Ketamine use in youths ages 16–23 years has been reported to be more common among whites (0.5%) than among other ethnic groups (range 0%–0.3%)(Wu et al. 2006). Among individuals admitted to substance abuse treatment, those for whom phencyclidine was the primary substance were predominantly black (49%) or Hispanic (29%)(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2004).', "Males make up about three-quarters of those with phencyclidine-related emergency room visits(Thombs 1989).Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is present in the urine in intoxicated individuals up to 8 days after ingestion(Martin 2008). The individual’s history, along with certain physical signs, such as nystagmus, analgesia and prominent hypertension, may aid in distinguishing the phencyclidine clinical picture from that of other hallucinogens. In individuals with phencyclidine use disorder, there may be physical evidence of injuries from accidents, fights, and falls. Chronic use of phencyclidine may lead to deficits in memory, speech, and cognition that may last for months(Hanson et al. 2012). Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities (e.g., seizures, dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy, hypothermia or hyperthermia) may result from intoxication with phencyclidine(O'Brien 2011). Other consequences include intracranial hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory problems, and (occasionally) cardiac arrest(Baldridge and Bessen 1990).", 'Other substance use disorders', '', 'Distinguishing the effects of phencyclidine from those of other substances is important, since it may be a common additive to other substances (e.g., cannabis, cocaine).', 'Schizophrenia and other mental disorders', '', 'Some of the effects of phencyclidine and related substance use may resemble symptoms of other psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis (schizophrenia), low mood (major depressive disorder), violent aggressive behaviors (conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder). Discerning whether these behaviors occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the differentiation of acute drug effects from preexisting mental disorder. Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered when there is impaired reality testing in individuals experiencing disturbances in perception resulting from ingestion of phencyclidine.', '', '']
