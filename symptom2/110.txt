The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history. Symptoms are worse when the individual is at rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort to relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or night, and in some individuals they occur only in the evening or night. Evening worsening occurs independently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other conditions such as positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D).', '', 'The symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and are associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained from moving the legs may no longer be apparent in severe cases. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness and is frequently accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment.', 'Periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) can serve as corroborating evidence for RLS, with up to 90% of individuals diagnosed with RLS demonstrating PLMS when recordings are taken over multiple nights(Trotti and Rye 2011; Trotti et al. 2009). Periodic leg movements during wakefulness are supportive of an RLS diagnosis. Reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and of excessive daytime sleepiness may also support the diagnosis of RLS. Additional supportive features include a family history of RLS among first-degree relatives and a reduction in symptoms, at least initially, with dopaminergic treatment(Allen et al. 2003). Prevalence rates of RLS vary widely when broad criteria are utilized but range from 2% to 7.2% when more defined criteria are employed. When frequency of symptoms is at least three times per week with moderate or severe distress, the prevalence rate is 1.6%; when frequency of symptoms is a minimum of one time per week, the prevalence rate is 4.5%. Females are 1.5–2 times more likely than males to have RLS. RLS also increases with age. The prevalence of RLS may be lower in Asian populations(Ohayon et al. 2011). The onset of RLS typically occurs in the second or third decade. Approximately 40% of individuals diagnosed with RLS during adulthood report having experienced symptoms before age 20 years, and 20% report having experienced symptoms before age 10 years. Prevalence rates of RLS increase steadily with age until about age 60 years, with symptoms remaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups(Ohayon et al. 2011). Compared with nonfamilial cases, familial RLS usually has a younger age at onset and a slower progressive course. The clinical course of RLS differs by age at onset. When onset occurs before age 45, there is often a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid progression is typical, and aggravating factors are common(Allen and Earley 2000). Symptoms of RLS appear similar across the lifespan, remaining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups(Allen and Earley 2000; Ohayon et al. 2011).', 'Diagnosis of RLS in children can be difficult because of the self-report component(Picchietti and Picchietti 2010). While Criterion A for adults assumes that the description of “urge to move” is by the patient, pediatric diagnosis requires a description in the child’s own words rather than by a parent or caretaker. Typically children age 6 years or older are able to provide detailed, adequate descriptors of RLS. However, children rarely use or understand the word “urge,” reporting instead that their legs “have to” or “got to” move. Also, potentially related to prolonged periods of sitting during class, two-thirds of children and adolescents report daytime leg sensations. Thus, for diagnostic Criterion A3, it is important to compare equal duration of sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in the evening or night. Nocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of pediatric RLS. As with RLS in adults, there is a significant negative impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Impairment in children and adolescents is manifested more often in behavioral and educational domains. ', 'Predisposing factors include female gender, advancing age, genetic risk variants, and family history of RLS. Precipitating factors are often time-limited, such as iron deficiency, with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns after the initial triggering event has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in RLS secondary to such disorders as uremia(Schormair et al. 2011), suggesting that individuals with a genetic susceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial component.', '', 'There are defined pathophysiological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide association studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with common genetic variants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1, BTBD9, and MAP2K5 on chromosomes 2p, 6p, and 15q, respectively(Winkelmann et al. 2007; Winkelmann et al. 2011). The association of these three variants with RLS has been independently replicated(Stefansson et al. 2007; Vilariño-Güell et al. 2008; Winkelmann et al. 2011). BTBD9 confers a very large (80%) excessive risk when even a single allele is present. Because of the high frequency of this variant in individuals of European descent, the population attributable risk (PAR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associated with MEIS1 and BTBD9 are less common in individuals of African or Asian descent, perhaps suggesting lower risk for RLS in these populations.', '', 'Pathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also include disturbances in the central dopaminergic system and disturbances in iron metabolism. The endogenous opiate system may also be involved(Trotti and Rye 2011). Treatment effects of dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-ergot agonists) provide further support that RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central dopaminergic pathways(Bliwise et al. 2005; Zintzaras et al. 2010). While the effective treatment of RLS has also been shown to significantly reduce depressive symptoms(Trotti and Rye 2011), serotonergic antidepressants can induce or aggravate RLS in some individuals(Rottach et al. 2008). ', 'Although RLS is more prevalent in females than in males, there are no diagnostic differences according to gender. However, the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is two to three times greater than in the general population. RLS associated with pregnancy peaks during the third trimester and improves or resolves in most cases soon after delivery. The gender difference in prevalence of RLS is explained at least in part by parity, with nulliparous females being at the same risk of RLS as age-matched males(Ekbom and Ulfberg 2009; Pantaleo et al. 2010; Trotti and Rye 2011).Polysomnography demonstrates significant abnormalities in RLS, commonly increased latency to sleep, and higher arousal index(Allen et al. 2003; Hornyak et al. 2007; Winkelman et al. 2009). Polysomnography with a preceding immobilization test may provide an indicator of the motor sign of RLS, periodic limb movements, under standard conditions of sleep and during quiet resting, both of which can provoke RLS symptoms.', '', 'Forms of RLS severe enough to significantly impair functioning or associated with mental disorders, including depression and anxiety, occur in approximately 2%–3% of the population(Cho et al. 2009; Hening et al. 2004; Trenkwalder et al. 2009; Winkelmann et al. 2005).', '', 'Although the impact of milder symptoms is less well characterized, individuals with RLS complain of disruption in at least one activity of daily living, with up to 50% reporting a negative impact on mood, and 47.6% reporting a lack of energy(Allen et al. 2005). The most common consequences of RLS are sleep disturbance, including reduced sleep time, sleep fragmentation, and overall disturbance(Allen et al. 2003; Hornyak et al. 2007; Winkelman et al. 2009); depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (Cho et al. 2009; Winkelmann et al. 2005); and quality-of-life impairments(Allen et al. 2010; McCrink et al. 2007; Trotti and Rye 2011; Winkelman et al. 2009). RLS can result in daytime sleepiness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant distress or impairment in affective, social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning.', '', 'The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, positional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg edema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping. “Knotting” of the muscle (cramps), relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to palpation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic of RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the desire to move the limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less common conditions to be differentiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-induced restlessness. Worsening at night and periodic limb movements are more common in RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy.', '', 'While is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these similar conditions can occur in an individual with RLS. This necessitates a separate focus on each possible condition in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a family history of RLS, may be helpful. Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic agent and positive family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.', 'Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and attentional disorders are commonly comorbid with RLS and are discussed in the section “Functional Consequences of Restless Legs Syndrome.” The main medical disorder comorbid with RLS is cardiovascular disease(Winkelman et al. 2008). There may be an association with numerous other medical disorders, including hypertension, narcolepsy, migraine, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid disease, and cancer. Iron deficiency, pregnancy, and chronic renal failure are also comorbid with RLS.The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), presents similar diagnostic criteria for RLS but does not contain a criterion specifying frequency or duration of symptoms.', '', '']
