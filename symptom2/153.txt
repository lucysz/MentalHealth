Depending on the specific hallucinogen, the intoxication may last only minutes (e.g., for salvia) or several hours or longer (e.g., for LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] or MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine]).The prevalence of other hallucinogen intoxication may be estimated by use of those substances. In the United States, 1.8% of individuals age 12 years or older report using hallucinogens in the past year. Use is more prevalent among younger individuals, with 3.1% of 12- to 17-year-olds and 7.1% of 18- to 25-year-olds using hallucinogens in the past year, compared with only 0.7% of individuals age 26 years or older(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011). Twelve-month prevalence for hallucinogen use is more common in males (2.4%) than in females (1.2%), and even more so among 18- to 25-year-olds (9.2% for males vs. 5.0% for females). In contrast, among individuals ages 12–17 years, there are no gender differences (3.1% for both genders). These figures may be used as proxy estimates for gender-related differences in the prevalence of other hallucinogen intoxication. Other hallucinogen intoxication may lead to increased suicidality, although suicide is rare among users of hallucinogens(Halpern 2003; Martin 2008).Other hallucinogen intoxication can have serious consequences. The perceptual disturbances and impaired judgment associated with other hallucinogen intoxication can result in injuries or fatalities from automobile crashes, physical fights, or unintentional self-injury (e.g., attempts to “fly” from high places). Environmental factors and the personality and expectations of the individual using the hallucinogen may contribute to the nature of and severity of hallucinogen intoxication. Continued use of hallucinogens, particularly MDMA, has also been linked with neurotoxic effects(de Win et al. 2008).Other hallucinogen intoxication should be differentiated from intoxication with amphetamines, cocaine, or other stimulants; anticholinergics; inhalants; and phencyclidine. Toxicological tests are useful in making this distinction, and determining the route of administration may also be useful.Other disorders and conditions to be considered include schizophrenia, depression, withdrawal from other drugs (e.g., sedatives, alcohol), certain metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia), seizure disorders, tumors of the central nervous system, and vascular insults(El-Mallakh et al. 2008).Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from hallucinogen persisting perception disorder because the symptoms in the latter continue episodically or continuously for weeks (or longer) after the most recent intoxication.Other hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from the other hallucinogen-induced disorders (e.g., hallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.', '', '']
