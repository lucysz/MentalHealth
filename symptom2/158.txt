Volatile hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and other volatile compounds. When it is possible to do so, the particular substance involved should be named (e.g., toluene intoxication). Among those who do, the intoxication clears within a few minutes to a few hours after the exposure ends. Thus, inhalant intoxication usually occurs in brief episodes that may recur.Inhalant intoxication may be indicated by evidence of possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant substances (e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters); apparent intoxication occurring in the age range with the highest prevalence of inhalant use (12–17 years); and apparent intoxication with negative results from the standard drug screens that usually fail to identify inhalants.The prevalence of actual episodes of inhalant intoxication in the general population is unknown, but it is probable that most inhalant users would at some time exhibit use that would meet criteria for inhalant intoxication disorder. Therefore, the prevalence of inhalant use and the prevalence of inhalant intoxication disorder are likely similar. In 2009 and 2010, inhalant use in the past year was reported by 0.8% of all Americans older than 12 years; the prevalence was highest in younger age groups (3.6% for individuals 12 to 17 years old, and 1.7% for individuals 18 to 25 years old)(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011a).Gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant intoxication in the general population are unknown. However, if it is assumed that most inhalant users eventually experience inhalant intoxication, gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant users likely approximate those in the proportions of males and females experiencing inhalant intoxication. Regarding gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant users in the United States, 1% of males older than 12 years and 0.7% of females older than 12 years have used inhalants in the previous year, but in the younger age groups more females than males have used inhalants (e.g., among 12- to 17-year-olds, 3.6% of males and 4.2% of females)(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011b).Use of inhaled substances in a closed container, such as a plastic bag over the head, may lead to unconsciousness, anoxia, and death. Separately, “sudden sniffing death,” likely from cardiac arrhythmia or arrest, may occur with various volatile inhalants. The enhanced toxicity of certain volatile inhalants, such as butane or propane, also causes fatalities(Marsolek et al. 2010). Although inhalant intoxication itself is of short duration, it may produce persisting medical and neurological problems, especially if the intoxications are frequent.', 'Inhalant exposure, without meeting the criteria for inhalant intoxication disorder', '', 'The individual intentionally or unintentionally inhaled substances, but the dose was insufficient for the diagnostic criteria for inhalant use disorder to be met.', 'Intoxication and other substance/medication-induced disorders from other substances, especially from sedating substances (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates)', '', 'These disorders may have similar signs and symptoms, but the intoxication is attributable to other intoxicants that may be identified via a toxicology screen. Differentiating the source of the intoxication may involve discerning evidence of inhalant exposure as described for inhalant use disorder. A diagnosis of inhalant intoxication may be suggested by possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant substances (e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters,); paraphernalia possession (e.g., rags or bags for concentrating glue fumes); perioral or perinasal “glue-sniffer’s rash”; reports from family or friends that the intoxicated individual possesses or uses inhalants; apparent intoxication despite negative results on standard drug screens (which usually fail to identify inhalants); apparent intoxication occurring in that age range with the highest prevalence of inhalant use (12–17 years); association with others known to use inhalants; membership in certain small communities with prevalent inhalant use (e.g., some native or aboriginal communities, homeless street children and adolescents); or unusual access to certain inhalant substances.', 'Other inhalant-related disorders', '', 'Episodes of inhalant intoxication do occur during, but are not identical with, other inhalant-related disorders. Those inhalant-related disorders are recognized by their respective diagnostic criteria: inhalant use disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive disorder, inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, inhalant-induced depressive disorder, inhalant-induced anxiety disorder, and other inhalant-induced disorders.', 'Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders that impair brain function and cognition', '', 'Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce the clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that also characterize inhalant intoxication.', '', '']
