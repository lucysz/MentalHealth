['Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder', 'This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified hypersomnolence disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “brief-duration hypersomnolence,” as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).', '', '']
