['Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder', 'This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-wake disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other specified hypersomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording “other specified sleep-wake disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without polysomnography or history of Parkinson’s disease or other synucleinopathy”).', '', '']
