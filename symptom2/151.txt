Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.', '', 'Hallucinogens comprise a diverse group of substances that, despite having different chemical structures and possibly involving different molecular mechanisms, produce similar alterations of perception, mood, and cognition in users. Hallucinogens included are phenylalkylamines (e.g., mescaline, DOM [2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine], and MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; also called “ecstasy”]); the indoleamines, including psilocybin (i.e., psilocin) and dimethyltryptamine (DMT); and the ergolines, such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and morning glory seeds. In addition, miscellaneous other ethnobotanical compounds are classified as “hallucinogens,” of which Salvia divinorum and jimsonweed are two examples. Excluded from the hallucinogen group are cannabis and its active compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (see the section “Cannabis-Related Disorders”). These substances can have hallucinogenic effects but are diagnosed separately because of significant differences in their psychological and behavioral effects.', '', 'Hallucinogens are usually taken orally, although some forms are smoked (e.g., DMT, salvia) or (rarely) taken intranasally or by injection (e.g., ecstasy). Duration of effects varies across types of hallucinogens. Some of these substances (i.e., LSD, MDMA) have a long half-life and extended duration such that users may spend hours to days using and/or recovering from the effects of these drugs. However, other hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., DMT, salvia) are short acting. Tolerance to hallucinogens develops with repeated use and has been reported to have both autonomic and psychological effects(Passie et al. 2008). Cross-tolerance exists between LSD and other hallucinogens (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline) but does not extend to other drug categories such as amphetamines and cannabis(Passie et al. 2008).', '', 'MDMA/ecstasy as a hallucinogen may have distinctive effects attributable to both its hallucinogenic and its stimulant properties. Among heavy ecstasy users, continued use despite physical or psychological problems, tolerance, hazardous use, and spending a great deal of time obtaining the substance are the most commonly reported criteria—over 50% in adults(Cottler et al. 2009) and over 30% in a younger sample(Cottler et al. 2001), while legal problems related to substance use and persistent desire/inability to quit are rarely reported. As found for other substances, diagnostic criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder are arrayed along a single continuum of severity(Kerridge et al. 2011; L. T. Wu et al. 2010).', '', 'One of the generic criteria for substance use disorders, a clinically significant withdrawal syndrome, has not been consistently documented in humans, and therefore the diagnosis of hallucinogen withdrawal syndrome is not included in DSM-5. However, there is evidence of withdrawal from MDMA, with endorsement of two or more withdrawal symptoms observed in 59%–98% in selected samples of ecstasy users. Both psychological and physical problems have been commonly reported as withdrawal problems(Cottler et al. 2001; Cottler et al. 2009).', 'The characteristic symptom features of some of the hallucinogens can aid in diagnosis if urine or blood toxicology results are not available. For example, individuals who use LSD tend to experience visual hallucinations that can be frightening. Individuals intoxicated with hallucinogens may exhibit a temporary increase in suicidality(Halpern 2003).', '', 'Of all substance use disorders, other hallucinogen use disorder is one of the rarest. The 12-month prevalence is estimated to be 0.5% among 12- to 17-year-olds(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011) and 0.1% among adults age 18 and older in the United States(Compton et al. 2007). Rates are higher in adult males (0.2%) compared with females (0.1%), but the opposite is observed in adolescent samples ages 12–17, in which the 12-month rate is slightly higher in females (0.6%) than in males (0.4%). Rates are highest in individuals younger than 30 years, with the peak occurring in individuals ages 18–29 years (0.6%) and decreasing to virtually 0.0% among individuals age 45 and older.', '', 'There are marked ethnic differences in 12-month prevalence of other hallucinogen use disorder. Among youths ages 12–17 years, 12-month prevalence is higher among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (1.2%) than among Hispanics (0.6%), whites (0.6%), African Americans (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.2%). Among adults, 12-month prevalence of other hallucinogen use disorder is similar for Native Americans and Alaska Natives, whites, and Hispanics (all 0.2%) but somewhat lower for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.07%) and African Americans (0.03%). Past-year prevalence is higher in clinical samples (e.g., 19% in adolescents in treatment)(Chung and Martin 2005). Among individuals currently using hallucinogens in the general population, 7.8% (adult) to 17% (adolescent) had a problematic pattern of use that met criteria for past-year other hallucinogen use disorder (Wu et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009b). Among select groups of individuals who use hallucinogens (e.g., recent heavy ecstasy use), 73.5% of adults and 77% of adolescents have a problematic pattern of use that may meet other hallucinogen use disorder criteria(Cottler et al. 2001; Cottler et al. 2009).', '', 'Unlike most substances where an early age at onset is associated with elevations in risk for the corresponding use disorder, it is unclear whether there is an association of an early age at onset with elevations in risk for other hallucinogen use disorder. However, patterns of drug consumption have been found to differ by age at onset, with early-onset ecstasy users more likely to be polydrug users than their later-onset counterparts(Wu et al. 2009c). There may be a disproportionate influence of use of specific hallucinogens on risk of developing other hallucinogen use disorder, with use of ecstasy/MDMA increasing the risk of the disorder relative to use of other hallucinogens(Wu et al. 2009b).', '', 'Little is known regarding the course of other hallucinogen use disorder, but it is generally thought to have low incidence, low persistence, and high rates of recovery. Adolescents are especially at risk for using these drugs, and it is estimated that 2.7% of youths ages 12–17 years have used one or more of these drugs in the past 12 months, with 44% having used ecstasy/MDMA(Wu et al. 2009b). Other hallucinogen use disorder is a disorder observed primarily in individuals younger than 30 years, with rates vanishingly rare among older adults.', 'In adolescents but not consistently in adults, MDMA use is associated with an elevated rate of other hallucinogen use disorder (Wu et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009a; Wu et al. 2009b). Other substance use disorders, particularly alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis, and major depressive disorder are associated with elevated rates of other hallucinogen use disorder (Wu et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009b). Antisocial personality disorder may be elevated among individuals who use more than two other drugs in addition to hallucinogens, compared with their counterparts with less extensive use history(Wu et al. 2009c). The influence of adult antisocial behaviors—but not conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder—on other hallucinogen use disorder may be stronger in females than in males(Compton et al. 2005). Use of specific hallucinogens (e.g., salvia) is prominent among individuals ages 18–25 years with other risk-taking behaviors and illegal activities(Perron et al. 2012). Cannabis use has also been implicated as a precursor to initiation of use of hallucinogens (e.g., ecstasy)(Zimmermann et al. 2005), along with early use of alcohol and tobacco(P. Wu et al. 2010). Higher drug use by peers and high sensation seeking have also been associated with elevated rates of ecstasy use(Martins et al. 2008). MDMA/ecstasy use appears to signify a more severe group of hallucinogen users.Among male twins, total variance due to additive genetics has been estimated to range from 26% to 79%, with inconsistent evidence for shared environmental influences(Kendler et al. 2000; Tsuang et al. 1998). Historically, hallucinogens have been used as part of established religious practices, such as the use of peyote in the Native American Church and in Mexico. Ritual use by indigenous populations of psilocybin obtained from certain types of mushrooms has occurred in South America, Mexico, and some areas in the United States, or of ayahuasca in the Santo Daime and União de Vegetal sects(El-Mallakh et al. 2008). Regular use of peyote as part of religious rituals is not linked to neuropsychological or psychological deficits(Halpern et al. 2005). For adults, no race or ethnicity differences for the full criteria or for any individual criterion are apparent at this time. In adolescents, females may be less likely than males to endorse “hazardous use,” and female gender may be associated with increased odds of other hallucinogen use disorder (L. T. Wu et al. 2010).Laboratory testing can be useful in distinguishing among the different hallucinogens. However, because some agents (e.g., LSD) are so potent that as little as 75 micrograms can produce severe reactions, typical toxicological examination will not always reveal which substance has been used. There is evidence for long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy use, including impairments in memory, psychological function, and neuroendocrine function; serotonin system dysfunction; and sleep disturbance; as well as adverse effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and damage to axons(Gouzoulis-Mayfrank and Daumann 2009). Use of MDMA/ecstasy may diminish functional connectivity among brain regions(Salomon et al. 2011). The effects of hallucinogens must be distinguished from those of other substances (e.g., amphetamines), especially because contamination of the hallucinogens with other drugs is relatively common. Schizophrenia also must be ruled out, as some affected individuals (e.g., individuals with schizophrenia who exhibit paranoia) may falsely attribute their symptoms to use of hallucinogens(El-Mallakh et al. 2008). Other potential disorders or conditions to consider include panic disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, alcohol or sedative withdrawal, hypoglycemia and other metabolic conditions, seizure disorder, stroke, ophthalmological disorder, and central nervous system tumors(El-Mallakh et al. 2008). Careful history of drug taking, collateral reports from family and friends (if possible), age, clinical history, physical examination, and toxicology reports should be useful in arriving at the final diagnostic decision. Adolescents who use MDMA/ecstasy and other hallucinogens, as well as adults who have recently used ecstasy, have a higher prevalence of other substance use disorders compared with nonhallucinogen substance users(Wu et al. 2009a; Wu et al. 2009b). Individuals who use hallucinogens exhibit elevations of nonsubstance mental disorders (especially anxiety, depressive, and bipolar disorders), particularly with use of ecstasy and salvia(Perron et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2009a; Wu et al. 2009c). Rates of antisocial personality disorder (but not conduct disorder) are significantly elevated among individuals with other hallucinogen use disorder, as are rates of adult antisocial behavior(Compton et al. 2005). However, it is unclear whether the mental illnesses may be precursors to rather than consequences of other hallucinogen use disorder (see the section “Risk and Prognostic Factors” for this disorder). Both adults and adolescents who use ecstasy are more likely than other drug users to be polydrug users and to have other drug use disorders(Wu et al. 2009a; Wu et al. 2009b). ', '', '']
