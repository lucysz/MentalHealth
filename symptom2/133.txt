For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.', '', 'Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.', 'The impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid onset and, typically, little or no prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for less than 30 minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by a close intimate or associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder often have less severe episodes of verbal and/or nondamaging, nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Criterion A1) in between more severe destructive/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2). Criterion A1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months) aggressive outbursts characterized by temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault without damage to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion A2 defines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year period) impulsive aggressive outbursts characterized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting/striking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual. Regardless of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core feature of intermittent explosive disorder is failure to control impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjectively experienced provocation (i.e., psychosocial stressor) that would not typically result in an aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts are generally impulsive and/or anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated with significant distress or impairment in psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6 years, or the equivalent developmental level (Criterion E), or to individuals whose aggressive outbursts are better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F). In addition, children ages 6–18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F). Mood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated with intermittent explosive disorder, although onset of these disorders is typically later than that of intermittent explosive disorder(Coccaro 2012). One-year prevalence data for intermittent explosive disorder in the United States is about 2.7% (narrow definition)(Kessler et al. 2006). Intermittent explosive disorder is more prevalent among younger individuals (e.g., younger than 35–40 years), compared with older individuals (older than 50 years), and in individuals with a high school education or less(Kessler and Üstün 2008).', '', 'The onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior is most common in late childhood or adolescence and rarely begins for the first time after age 40 years(Coccaro 2012). The core features of intermittent explosive disorder, typically, are persistent and continue for many years.', '', 'The course of the disorder may be episodic, with recurrent periods of impulsive aggressive outbursts. Intermittent explosive disorder appears to follow a chronic and persistent course over many years(Kessler and Üstün 2008). It also appears to be quite common regardless of the presence(Coccaro 2012) or absence(McLaughlin et al. 2012) of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders (e.g., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder).', 'Individuals with a history of physical and emotional trauma during the first two decades of life are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder (Coccaro 2012).', '', 'First-degree relatives of individuals with intermittent explosive disorder are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder(Coccaro 2012), and twin studies have demonstrated a substantial genetic influence for impulsive aggression(Bergeman and Serocyznski 1998).', '', 'Research provides neurobiological support for the presence of serotonergic abnormalities, globally(Coccaro et al. 2010) and in the brain, specifically in areas of the limbic system (anterior cingulate)(New et al. 2002) and orbitofrontal cortex(Siever et al. 1999) in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Amygdala responses to anger stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, are greater in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder compared with healthy individuals(Coccaro et al. 2007).', 'The lower prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder in some regions (Asia, Middle East) or countries (Romania, Nigeria), compared with the United States, suggests that information about recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behaviors either is not elicited on questioning or is less likely to be present, because of cultural factors.In some studies the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder is greater in males than in females (odds ratio = 1.4–2.3); other studies have found no gender difference(Coccaro 2012). Social (e.g., loss of friends, relatives, marital instability), occupational (e.g., demotion, loss of employment), financial (e.g., due to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e.g., civil suits as a result of aggressive behavior against person or property; criminal charges for assault) problems often develop as a result of intermittent explosive disorder. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when Criteria A1 and/or A2 are only met during an episode of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or when impulsive aggressive outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance or medication. This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and adolescents ages 6–18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder. Other examples in which recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts may, or may not, be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder include the following.', 'Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder', '', 'In contrast to intermittent explosive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a persistently negative mood state (i.e., irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive outbursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can only be given when the onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years. Finally, a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be made for the first time after age 18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive.', 'Antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder', '', 'Individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent, problematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression in individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder is lower than that in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder.', 'Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to another medical condition, aggressive type', '', 'A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the physiological effects of another diagnosable medical condition (e.g., brain injury associated with a change in personality characterized by aggressive outbursts; complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities on neurological examination (e.g., “soft signs”) and nonspecific electroencephalographic changes are compatible with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder unless there is a diagnosable medical condition that better explains the impulsive aggressive outbursts.', 'Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal', '', 'A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always associated with intoxication with or withdrawal from substances (e.g., alcohol, phencyclidine, cocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants). However, when a sufficient number of impulsive aggressive outbursts also occur in the absence of substance intoxication or withdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.', 'Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder', '', 'Individuals with any of these childhood-onset disorders may exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically impulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While individuals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts, the form of aggression characterized by the diagnostic criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in oppositional defiant disorder is typically characterized by temper tantrums and verbal arguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are in response to a broader array of provocation and include physical assault. The level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of these disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparable individuals whose symptoms also meet intermittent explosive disorder Criteria A through E(Coccaro 2012). Accordingly, if Criteria A through E are also met, and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.', 'Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are most commonly comorbid with intermittent explosive disorder (Coccaro 2012). In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of disorders with disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder), are at greater risk for comorbid intermittent explosive disorder (Coccaro 2012).', '', '']
