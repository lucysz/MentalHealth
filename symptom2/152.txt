The most common clinical presentations of phencyclidine intoxication include disorientation, confusion without hallucinations, hallucinations or delusions, a catatonic-like syndrome, and coma of varying severity(McCarron et al. 1981a). The intoxication typically lasts for several hours but, depending on the type of clinical presentation and whether other drugs besides phencyclidine were consumed, may last for several days or longer(McCarron et al. 1981a).Use of phencyclidine or related substances may be taken as an estimate of the prevalence of intoxication. Approximately 2.5% of the population reports having ever used phencyclidine(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011). Among high school students, 2.3% of 12th graders report ever using phencyclidine, with 57% having used in the past 12 months(Johnston et al. 2012). This represents an increase from prior to 2011. Past-year use of ketamine, which is assessed separately from other substances, has remained stable over time, with about 1.7% of 12th graders reporting use.Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is detectable in urine for up to 8 days following use, although the levels are only weakly associated with an individual’s clinical presentation and may therefore not be useful for case management. Creatine phosphokinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels may be elevated.Phencyclidine intoxication produces extensive cardiovascular and neurological (e.g., seizures, dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy, hypothermia or hyperthermia) toxicity.In particular, in the absence of intact reality testing (i.e., without insight into any perceptual abnormalities), an additional diagnosis of phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.Phencyclidine intoxication should be differentiated from intoxication due to other substances, including other hallucinogens; amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulants; and anticholinergics, as well as withdrawal from benzodiazepines(Bey and Patel 2007). Nystagmus and bizarre and violent behavior may distinguish intoxication due to phencyclidine from that due to other substances(Baldridge and Bessen 1990; McCarron et al. 1981b). Toxicological tests may be useful in making this distinction, since phencyclidine is detectable in urine for up to 8 days after use. However, there is a weak correlation between quantitative toxicology levels of phencyclidine and clinical presentation that diminishes the utility of the laboratory findings for patient management(Baldridge and Bessen 1990; Bey and Patel 2007; McCarron et al. 1981b). Other conditions to be considered include schizophrenia, depression, withdrawal from other drugs (e.g., sedatives, alcohol), certain metabolic disorders like hypoglycemia and hyponatremia, central nervous system tumors, seizure disorders, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and vascular insults(Bey and Patel 2007).', '', '']
