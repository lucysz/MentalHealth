The personality disturbance represents a change from the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern. In children, this condition may be manifested as a marked deviation from normal development rather than as a change in a stable personality pattern (Criterion A). There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the personality change is the direct physiological consequence of another medical condition (Criterion B). The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance is better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The disturbance must also cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E).', '', 'Common manifestations of the personality change include affective instability, poor impulse control, outbursts of aggression or rage grossly out of proportion to any precipitating psychosocial stressor, marked apathy, suspiciousness, or paranoid ideation. The phenomenology of the change is indicated using the subtypes listed in the criteria set. An individual with the disorder is often characterized by others as “not himself [or herself].” Although it shares the term “personality” with the other personality disorders, this diagnosis is distinct by virtue of its specific etiology, different phenomenology, and more variable onset and course.', '', 'The clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on the nature and localization of the pathological process. For example, injury to the frontal lobes may yield symptoms such as lack of judgment or foresight, facetiousness, disinhibition, and euphoria. Right hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality changes in association with unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia (i.e., inability of the individual to recognize a bodily or functional deficit, such as the existence of hemiparesis), motor impersistence, and other neurological deficits.', 'A variety of neurological and other medical conditions may cause personality changes, including central nervous system neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, infectious conditions with central nervous system involvement (e.g., HIV), endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypo- and hyperadrenocorticism), and autoimmune conditions with central nervous system involvement (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and patterns of prevalence and onset reflect those of the neurological or other medical condition involved.', 'Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability', '', 'Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and disability can also be associated with changes in personality. The diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is given only if a direct pathophysiological mechanism can be established. This diagnosis is not given if the change is due to a behavioral or psychological adjustment or response to another medical condition (e.g., dependent behaviors that result from a need for the assistance of others following a severe head trauma, cardiovascular disease, or dementia).', 'Delirium or major neurocognitive disorder', '', 'Personality change is a frequently associated feature of a delirium or major neurocognitive disorder. A separate diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is not given if the change occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, the diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition may be given in addition to the diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder if the personality change is a prominent part of the clinical presentation.', 'Another mental disorder due to another medical condition', '', 'The diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance is better explained by another mental disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., depressive disorder due to brain tumor).', 'Substance use disorders', '', 'Personality changes may also occur in the context of substance use disorders, especially if the disorder is long-standing. The clinician should inquire carefully about the nature and extent of substance use. If the clinician wishes to indicate an etiological relationship between the personality change and substance use, the unspecified category for the specific substance (e.g., unspecified stimulant-related disorder) can be used.', 'Other mental disorders', '', 'Marked personality changes may also be an associated feature of other mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; other specified and unspecified disruptive behavior, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; panic disorder). However, in these disorders, no specific physiological factor is judged to be etiologically related to the personality change.', 'Other personality disorders', '', 'Personality change due to another medical condition can be distinguished from a personality disorder by the requirement for a clinically significant change from baseline personality functioning and the presence of a specific etiological medical condition.', '', '']
