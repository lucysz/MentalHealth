The symptoms after abstinence from tobacco are in large part due to nicotine deprivation. Symptoms are much more intense among individuals who smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco than among those who use nicotine medications. This difference in symptom intensity is likely due to the more rapid onset and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking. Tobacco withdrawal is common among daily tobacco users who stop or reduce but can also occur among nondaily users. Typically, heart rate decreases by 5–12 beats per minute in the first few days after stopping smoking, and weight increases an average of 4–7 lb (2–3 kg) over the first year after stopping smoking. Tobacco withdrawal can produce clinically significant mood changes and functional impairment. Craving for sweet or sugary foods and impaired performance on tasks requiring vigilance are associated with tobacco withdrawal(Hughes 2007). Abstinence can increase constipation, coughing, dizziness, dreaming/nightmares, nausea, and sore throat. Smoking increases the metabolism of many medications used to treat mental disorders; thus, cessation of smoking can increase the blood levels of these medications, and this can produce clinically significant outcomes(Kroon 2007). This effect appears to be due not to nicotine but rather to other compounds in tobacco. Approximately 50% of tobacco users who quit for 2 or more days will have symptoms that meet criteria for tobacco withdrawal(Hughes 2007). The most commonly endorsed signs and symptoms are anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. The least commonly endorsed symptoms are depression and insomnia.', '', 'Tobacco withdrawal usually begins within 24 hours of stopping or cutting down on tobacco use, peaks at 2–3 days after abstinence, and lasts 2–3 weeks(Hughes 2007). Tobacco withdrawal symptoms can occur among adolescent tobacco users, even prior to daily tobacco use(DiFranza 2008). Prolonged symptoms beyond 1 month are uncommon.', 'Smokers with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other substance use disorders have more severe withdrawal(Ziedonis et al. 2008).Genotype can influence the probability of withdrawal upon abstinence(Pergadia et al. 2006). Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its metabolite cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine, can be used to measure the extent of tobacco or nicotine use but are only weakly related to tobacco withdrawal (SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemcial Verification 2002).Abstinence from cigarettes can cause clinically significant distress(Hughes 2007). Withdrawal impairs the ability to stop or control tobacco use. Whether tobacco withdrawal can prompt a new mental disorder or recurrence of a mental disorder is debatable(Prochaska et al. 2004), but if this occurs, it would be in a small minority of tobacco users. The symptoms of tobacco withdrawal overlap with those of other substance withdrawal syndromes (e.g., alcohol withdrawal; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; stimulant withdrawal; caffeine withdrawal; opioid withdrawal); caffeine intoxication; anxiety, depressive, bipolar, and sleep disorders; and medication-induced akathisia(Hughes 1993). Admission to smoke-free inpatient units or voluntary smoking cessation can induce withdrawal symptoms that mimic, intensify, or disguise other disorders or adverse effects of medications used to treat mental disorders (e.g., irritability thought to be due to alcohol withdrawal could be due to tobacco withdrawal). Reduction in symptoms with the use of nicotine medications confirms the diagnosis. ', '', '']
