These conditions include structural lesions (e.g., primary or secondary brain tumors, subdural hematoma, slowly progressive or normal-pressure hydrocephalus), hypoxia related to hypoperfusion from heart failure, endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia), nutritional conditions (e.g., deficiencies of thiamine or niacin), other infectious conditions (e.g., neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis), immune disorders (e.g., temporal arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), hepatic or renal failure, metabolic conditions (e.g., Kufs’ disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, other storage diseases of adulthood and childhood), and other neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, multiple sclerosis). Unusual causes of central nervous system injury, such as electrical shock or intracranial radiation, are generally evident from the history. The temporal association between the onset or exacerbation of the medical condition and the development of the cognitive deficit offers the greatest support that the NCD is induced by the medical condition. Diagnostic certainty regarding this relationship may be increased if the neurocognitive deficits ameliorate partially or stabilize in the context of treatment of the medical condition. Typically the course of the NCD progresses in a manner that is commensurate with progression of the underlying medical disorder. In circumstances where the medical disorder is treatable (e.g., hypothyroidism), the neurocognitive deficit may improve or at least not progress. When the medical condition has a deteriorative course (e.g., secondary progressive multiple sclerosis), the neurocognitive deficits will progress along with the temporal course of illness.Associated physical examination and laboratory findings and other clinical features depend on the nature and severity of the medical condition.', 'Other major or mild neurocognitive disorder', 'The presence of an attributable medical condition does not entirely exclude the possibility of another major or mild NCD. If cognitive deficits persist following successful treatment of an associated medical condition, then another etiology may be responsible for the cognitive decline.', '', '']
