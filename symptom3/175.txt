Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.', '', 'The diagnostic class other (or unknown) substance use and related disorders comprises substance-related disorders unrelated to alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (phencyclidine and others); inhalants; opioids; sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including amphetamine and cocaine); or tobacco. Such substances include anabolic steroids(Kanayama et al. 2009); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cortisol; antiparkinsonian medications(Dagher and Robbins 2009); antihistamines; nitrous oxide; amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrites(Wu et al. 2005); betel nut(Gupta and Ray 2004), which is chewed in many cultures to produce mild euphoria and a floating sensation; kava (from a South Pacific pepper plant), which produces sedation, incoordination, weight loss, mild hepatitis, and lung abnormalities; or cathinones (including khât plant agents and synthetic chemical derivatives) that produce stimulant effects(Kelly 2011). Unknown substance-related disorders are associated with unidentified substances, such as intoxications in which the individual cannot identify the ingested drug, or substance use disorders involving either new, black market drugs not yet identified or familiar drugs illegally sold under false names.', '', 'Other (or unknown) substance use disorder is a mental disorder in which repeated use of an other or unknown substance typically continues, despite the individual’s knowing that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual. Those problems are reflected in the diagnostic criteria. When the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., nitrous oxide use disorder).', '', 'A diagnosis of other (or unknown) substance use disorder is supported by the individual’s statement that the substance involved is not among the nine classes listed in this chapter; by recurring episodes of intoxication with negative results in standard drug screens (which may not detect new or rarely used substances); or by the presence of symptoms characteristic of an unidentified substance that has newly appeared in the individual’s community.', '', 'Because of increased access to nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”), membership in certain populations is associated with diagnosis of nitrous oxide use disorder. The role of this gas as an anesthetic agent leads to misuse by some medical and dental professionals(Blanton 2006). Its use as a propellant for commercial products (e.g., whipped cream dispensers) contributes to misuse by food service workers. With recent widespread availability of the substance in “whippet” cartridges for use in home whipped cream dispensers, nitrous oxide misuse by adolescents and young adults is significant(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 2008), especially among those who also inhale volatile hydrocarbons. Some continuously using individuals, inhaling from as many as 240 whippets per day, may present with serious medical complications and mental conditions, including myeloneuropathy(Alt et al. 2010), spinal cord subacute combined degeneration(Cartner et al. 2007), peripheral neuropathy(Richardson 2010), and psychosis(Sethi et al. 2006). These conditions are also associated with a diagnosis of nitrous oxide use disorder.', '', 'Use of amyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl nitrite gases has been observed among homosexual men(Colfax et al. 2005; Hidaka et al. 2006; Lampinen et al. 2007) and some adolescents, especially those with conduct disorder (Wu et al. 2005). Membership in these populations may be associated with a diagnosis of amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrite use disorder. However, it has not been determined that these substances produce a substance use disorder (Ridenour et al. 2007). Despite tolerance(Marsh and Marsh 2000), these gases may not alter behavior through central effects(Balster 1998), and they may be used only for their peripheral effects.', '', 'Substance use disorders generally are associated with elevated risks of suicide, but there is no evidence of unique risk factors for suicide with other (or unknown) substance use disorder.', 'Based on extremely limited data, the prevalence of other (or unknown) substance use disorder is likely lower than that of use disorders involving the nine substance classes in this chapter. No single pattern of development or course characterizes the pharmacologically varied other (or unknown) substance use disorders. Often unknown substance use disorders will be reclassified when the unknown substance eventually is identified. Risk and prognostic factors for other (or unknown) substance use disorders are thought to be similar to those for most substance use disorders and include the presence of any other substance use disorders, conduct disorder, or antisocial personality disorder in the individual or the individual’s family; early onset of substance problems; easy availability of the substance in the individual’s environment; childhood maltreatment or trauma; and evidence of limited early self-control and behavioral disinhibitionCertain cultures may be associated with other (or unknown) substance use disorders involving specific indigenous substances within the cultural region, such as betel nut.Urine, breath, or saliva tests may correctly identify a commonly used substance falsely sold as a novel product. However, routine clinical tests usually cannot identify truly unusual or new substances, which may require testing in specialized laboratories.', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Use of other or unknown substances without meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder', '', 'Use of unknown substances is not rare among adolescents, but most use does not meet the diagnostic standard of two or more criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder in the past year.', 'Substance use disorders', '', 'Other (or unknown) substance use disorder may co-occur with various substance use disorders, and the symptoms of the disorders may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when some of the substances were not being used.', 'Other (or unknown) substance/medication-induced disorder', '', 'This diagnosis should be differentiated from instances when the individual’s symptoms meet full criteria for one of the following disorders, and that disorder is caused by an other or unknown substance: delirium, major or mild neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, or sleep disorder.', 'Other medical conditions', '', 'Individuals with substance use disorders, including other (or unknown) substance use disorder, may present with symptoms of many medical disorders. These disorders also may occur in the absence of other (or unknown) substance use disorder. A history of little or no use of other or unknown substances helps to exclude other (or unknown) substance use disorder as the source of these problems.', 'Substance use disorders, including other (or unknown) substance use disorder, are commonly comorbid with one another, with adolescent conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder, and with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.', '', '']
