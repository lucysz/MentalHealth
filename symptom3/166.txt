This withdrawal syndrome is characterized by two or more symptoms (similar to alcohol withdrawal) that include autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, or body temperature, along with sweating); a tremor of the hands; insomnia; nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting; anxiety; and psychomotor agitation. A grand mal seizure may occur in perhaps as many as 20%–30% of individuals undergoing untreated withdrawal from these substances. In severe withdrawal, visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions can occur but are usually in the context of a delirium. If the individual’s reality testing is intact (i.e., he or she knows the substance is causing the hallucinations) and the illusions occur in a clear sensorium, the specifier “with perceptual disturbances” can be noted. When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality testing, a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., alcohol withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder) (Criterion D). Relief of withdrawal symptoms with administration of any sedative-hypnotic agent would support a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.', '', 'The timing and severity of the withdrawal syndrome will differ depending on the specific substance and its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For example, withdrawal from shorter-acting substances that are rapidly absorbed and that have no active metabolites (e.g., triazolam) can begin within hours after the substance is stopped; withdrawal from substances with long-acting metabolites (e.g., diazepam) may not begin for 1–2 days or longer. The withdrawal syndrome produced by substances in this class may be characterized by the development of a delirium that can be life-threatening. There may be evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of a diagnosis of a substance use disorder in an individual who has abruptly discontinued benzodiazepines that were taken for long periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses. However, ICD-10-CM codes only allow a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal in the presence of comorbid moderate to severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.', '', 'The time course of the withdrawal syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of the substance. Medications whose actions typically last about 10 hours or less (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) produce withdrawal symptoms within 6–8 hours of decreasing blood levels that peak in intensity on the second day and improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day. For substances with longer half-lives (e.g., diazepam), symptoms may not develop for more than 1 week, peak in intensity during the second week, and decrease markedly during the third or fourth week. There may be additional longer-term symptoms at a much lower level of intensity that persist for several months.', 'The longer the substance has been taken and the higher the dosages used, the more likely it is that there will be severe withdrawal. However, withdrawal has been reported with as little as 15 mg of diazepam (or its equivalent in other benzodiazepines) when taken daily for several months. Doses of approximately 40 mg of diazepam (or its equivalent) daily are more likely to produce clinically relevant withdrawal symptoms, and even higher doses (e.g., 100 mg of diazepam) are more likely to be followed by withdrawal seizures or delirium. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium is characterized by disturbances in consciousness and cognition, with visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations. When present, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium should be diagnosed instead of withdrawal.The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is unclear.Seizures and autonomic instability in the setting of a history of prolonged exposure to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications suggest a high likelihood of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.', 'Other medical disorders', '', 'The symptoms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may be mimicked by other medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis). If seizures are a feature of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal, the differential diagnosis includes the various causes of seizures (e.g., infections, head injury, poisonings).', 'Essential tremor', '', 'Essential tremor, a disorder that frequently runs in families, may erroneously suggest the tremulousness associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.', 'Alcohol withdrawal', '', 'Alcohol withdrawal produces a syndrome very similar to that of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.', 'Other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders', '', 'Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is distinguished from the other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate in the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.', 'Anxiety disorders', '', "Recurrence or worsening of an underlying anxiety disorder produces a syndrome similar to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal. Withdrawal would be suspected with an abrupt reduction in the dosage of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medication. When a taper is under way, distinguishing the withdrawal syndrome from the underlying anxiety disorder can be difficult(Licata and Rowlett 2008; O'Brien 2005). As with alcohol, lingering withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodiness, and trouble sleeping) can be mistaken for non-substance/medication-induced anxiety or depressive disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder).", '', '']
