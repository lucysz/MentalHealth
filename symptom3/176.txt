['Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication', '', '', '    The development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome attributable to recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance that is not listed elsewhere or is unknown.', '', '    Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes that are attributable to the effect of the substance on the central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor coordination, psychomotor agitation or retardation, euphoria, anxiety, belligerence, mood lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) and develop during, or shortly after, use of the substance.', '', '    The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another substance.', 'For information on Risk and Prognostic Factors, Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, and Diagnostic Markers, see the corresponding sections in other (or unknown) substance use disorder.', '', 'Other (or unknown) substance intoxication is a clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or immediately after, use of either a) a substance not elsewhere addressed in this chapter (i.e., alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; phencyclidine and other hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or b) an unknown substance. If the substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding.', '', 'Application of the diagnostic criteria for other (or unknown) substance intoxication is very challenging. Criterion A requires development of a reversible “substance-specific syndrome,” but if the substance is unknown, that syndrome usually will be unknown. To resolve this conflict, clinicians may ask the individual or obtain collateral history as to whether the individual has experienced a similar episode after using substances with the same “street” name or from the same source. Similarly, hospital emergency departments sometimes recognize over a few days numerous presentations of a severe, unfamiliar intoxication syndrome from a newly available, previously unknown substance. Because of the great variety of intoxicating substances, Criterion B can provide only broad examples of signs and symptoms from some intoxications, with no threshold for the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis; clinical judgment guides those decisions. Criterion C requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders, or intoxications.', 'The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance intoxication is unknown.Intoxications usually appear and then peak minutes to hours after use of the substance, but the onset and course vary with the substance and the route of administration. Generally, substances used by pulmonary inhalation and intravenous injection have the most rapid onset of action, while those ingested by mouth and requiring metabolism to an active product are much slower. (For example, after ingestion of certain mushrooms, the first signs of an eventually fatal intoxication may not appear for a few days.) Intoxication effects usually resolve within hours to a very few days. However, the body may completely eliminate an anesthetic gas such as nitrous oxide just minutes after use ends. At the other extreme, some “hit-and-run” intoxicating substances poison systems, leaving permanent impairments. For example, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a contaminating by-product in the synthesis of a certain opioid, kills dopaminergic cells and induces permanent parkinsonism in users who sought opioid intoxication(Langston and Palfreman 1995). Impairment from intoxication with any substance may have serious consequences, including dysfunction at work, social indiscretions, problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behaviors (i.e., having unprotected sex), and substance or medication overdose. The pattern of consequences will vary with the particular substance.', 'Use of other or unknown substance, without meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance intoxication', '', 'The individual used an other or unknown substance(s), but the dose was insufficient to produce symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria required for the diagnosis.', 'Substance intoxication or other substance/medication-induced disorders', '', 'Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products, and individuals may experience intoxication from those substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself may help to identify it.', 'Different types of other (or unknown) substance–related disorders', '', 'Episodes of other (or unknown) substance intoxication may occur during, but are distinct from, other (or unknown) substance use disorder, unspecified other (or unknown) substance–related disorder, and other (or unknown) substance–induced disorders.', 'Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain function and cognition', '', 'Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of intoxications, including the examples in Criterion B. Paradoxically, drug withdrawals also must be ruled out, because, for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication with another drug.', 'As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders tend to co-occur with other (or unknown) substance intoxication.', '', '']
