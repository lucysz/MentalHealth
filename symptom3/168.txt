Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.', '', 'The amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimulants include substances with a substituted-phenylethylamine structure, such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine. Also included are those substances that are structurally different but have similar effects, such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken orally or intravenously, although methamphetamine is also taken by the nasal route. In addition to the synthetic amphetamine-type compounds, there are naturally occurring, plant-derived stimulants such as khât. Amphetamines and other stimulants may be obtained by prescription for the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcolepsy. Consequently, prescribed stimulants may be diverted into the illegal market. The effects of amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are similar to those of cocaine, such that the criteria for stimulant use disorder are presented here as a single disorder with the ability to specify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be consumed in several preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine hydrochloride, and cocaine alkaloids such as freebase and crack) that differ in potency because of varying levels of purity and speed of onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active ingredient. Cocaine hydrochloride powder is usually “snorted” through the nostrils or dissolved in water and injected intravenously.', '', 'Individuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can develop stimulant use disorder as rapidly as 1 week, although the onset is not always this rapid. Regardless of the route of administration, tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and can enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have experienced tolerance or withdrawal.', '', 'Use patterns and course are similar for disorders involving amphetamine-type stimulants and cocaine, as both substances are potent central nervous system stimulants with similar psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are longer acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day(Cruickshank and Dyer 2009). Usage may be chronic or episodic, with binges punctuated by brief non-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior is common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense temporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as paranoid ideation and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high-dose use.', '', 'Withdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that can resemble a major depressive episode (Mooney et al. 2009); the depressive symptoms usually resolve within 1 week(Newton et al. 2004). Tolerance to amphetamine-type stimulants develops and leads to escalation of the dose. Conversely, some users of amphetamine-type stimulants develop sensitization, characterized by enhanced effects.', '', 'When injected or smoked, stimulants typically produce an instant feeling of well-being, confidence, and euphoria. Dramatic behavioral changes can rapidly develop with stimulant use disorder. Chaotic behavior, social isolation, aggressive behavior, and sexual dysfunction can result from long-term stimulant use disorder.', '', 'Individuals with acute intoxication may present with rambling speech, headache, transient ideas of reference, and tinnitus. There may be paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations in a clear sensorium, and tactile hallucinations, which the individual usually recognizes as drug effects. Threats or acting out of aggressive behavior may occur. Depression, suicidal ideation, irritability, anhedonia, emotional lability, or disturbances in attention and concentration commonly occur during withdrawal. Mental disturbances associated with cocaine use usually resolve hours to days after cessation of use but can persist for 1 month. Physiological changes during stimulant withdrawal are opposite to those of the intoxication phase, sometimes including bradycardia(McGregor et al. 2005). Temporary depressive symptoms may meet symptomatic and duration criteria for major depressive episode. Histories consistent with repeated panic attacks, social anxiety disorder (social phobia)–like behavior, and generalized anxiety–like syndromes are common, as are eating disorders. One extreme instance of stimulant toxicity is stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, a disorder that resembles schizophrenia, with delusions and hallucinations.', '', 'Individuals with stimulant use disorder often develop conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing any white powderlike substance). These responses contribute to relapse, are difficult to extinguish, and persist after detoxification.', '', 'Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are generally the most serious problems seen during stimulant withdrawal.', 'Stimulant use disorder: amphetamine-type stimulants', '', 'Estimated 12-month prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder in the United States is 0.2% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.2% among individuals 18 years and older(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011). Rates are similar among adult males and females (0.2%), but among 12- to 17-year-olds, the rate for females (0.3%) is greater than that for males (0.1%). Intravenous stimulant use has a male-to-female ratio of 3:1 or 4:1, but rates are more balanced among non-injecting users, with males representing 54% of primary treatment admissions. Twelve-month prevalence is greater among 18- to 29-year-olds (0.4%) compared with 45- to 64-year-olds (0.1%). For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are highest among whites and African Americans (0.3%) compared with Hispanics (0.1%) and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.01%), with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder virtually absent among Native Americans. Among adults, rates are highest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.6%) compared with whites (0.2%) and Hispanics (0.2%), with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder virtually absent among African Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Past-year nonprescribed use of prescription stimulants occurred among 5%–9% of children through high school, with 5%–35% of college-age persons reporting past-year use(Wilens et al. 2008).', 'Stimulant use disorder: cocaine', '', 'Estimated 12-month prevalence of cocaine use disorder in the United States is 0.2% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.3% among individuals 18 years and older(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011).

First regular use among individuals in treatment occurs, on average, at approximately age 23 years(Hser et al. 2008). For primary methamphetamine–primary treatment admissions, the average age is 31 years(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2008).', '', 'Some individuals begin stimulant use to control weight or to improve performance in school, work, or athletics. This includes obtaining medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamine salts prescribed to others for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Stimulant use disorder can develop rapidly with intravenous or smoked administration; among primary admissions for amphetamine-type stimulant use, 66% reported smoking, 18% reported injecting, and 10% reported snorting(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2009).', '', 'Patterns of stimulant administration include episodic or daily (or almost daily) use. Episodic use tends to be separated by 2 or more days of non-use (e.g., intense use over a weekend or on one or more weekdays). “Binges” involve continuous high-dose use over hours or days and are often associated with physical dependence. Binges usually terminate only when stimulant supplies are depleted or exhaustion ensues. Chronic daily use may involve high or low doses, often with an increase in dose over time.', '', 'Stimulant smoking and intravenous use are associated with rapid progression to severe-level stimulant use disorder, often occurring over weeks to months. Intranasal use of cocaine and oral use of amphetamine-type stimulants result in more gradual progression occurring over months to years. With continuing use, there is a diminution of pleasurable effects due to tolerance and an increase in dysphoric effects.', 'Comorbid bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use disorders are risk factors for developing stimulant use disorder and for relapse to cocaine use in treatment samples(Poling et al. 2007). Also, impulsivity and similar personality traits may affect treatment outcomes. Childhood conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder are associated with the later development of stimulant-related disorders.Predictors of cocaine use among teenagers include prenatal cocaine exposure, postnatal cocaine use by parents, and exposure to community violence during childhood(Delaney-Black et al. 2011). For youths, especially females, risk factors include living in an unstable home environment, having a psychiatric condition, and associating with dealers and users(Russell et al. 2008).Stimulant use–attendant disorders affect all racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, age, and gender groups. Diagnostic issues may be related to societal consequences (e.g., arrest, school suspensions, employment suspension). Despite small variations, cocaine and other stimulant use disorder diagnostic criteria perform equally across gender and race/ethnicity groups(Blanco et al. 2007; Schmidt and Room 1999; Wu et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2010).Chronic use of cocaine impairs cardiac left ventricular function in African Americans(Ren et al. 2006). Approximately 66% of individuals admitted for primary methamphetamine/amphetamine-related disorders are non-Hispanic white, followed by 21% of Hispanic origin, 3% Asian and Pacific Islander, and 3% non-Hispanic black(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2009).', '', 'Benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, typically remains in the urine for 1–3 days after a single dose and may be present for 7–12 days in individuals using repeated high doses. Mildly elevated liver function tests can be present in cocaine injectors or users with concomitant alcohol use. There are no neurobiological markers of diagnostic utility. Discontinuation of chronic cocaine use may be associated with electroencephalographic changes, suggesting persistent abnormalities(Levin et al. 2007); alterations in secretion patterns of prolactin; and downregulation of dopamine receptors.', '', 'Short-half-life amphetamine-type stimulants (MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine], methamphetamine) can be detected for 1–3 days, and possibly up to 4 days depending on dosage and metabolism. Hair samples can be used to detect presence of amphetamine-type stimulants for up to 90 days. Other laboratory findings, as well as physical findings and other medical conditions (e.g., weight loss, malnutrition; poor hygiene), are similar for both cocaine and amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder.', '', 'Various medical conditions may occur depending on the route of administration. Intranasal users often develop sinusitis, irritation, bleeding of the nasal mucosa, and a perforated nasal septum. Individuals who smoke the drugs are at increased risk for respiratory problems (e.g., coughing, bronchitis, and pneumonitis). Injectors have puncture marks and “tracks,” most commonly on their forearms. Risk of HIV infection increases with frequent intravenous injections and unsafe sexual activity. Other sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, and tuberculosis and other lung infections are also seen. Weight loss and malnutrition are common(Darke et al. 2008).', '', 'Chest pain may be a common symptom during stimulant intoxication (Schwartz et al. 2010). Myocardial infarction, palpitations and arrhythmias, sudden death from respiratory or cardiac arrest, and stroke have been associated with stimulant use among young and otherwise healthy individuals. Seizures can occur with stimulant use. Pneumothorax can result from performing Valsalva-like maneuvers done to better absorb inhaled smoke(Khalsa et al. 1992). Traumatic injuries due to violent behavior are common among individuals trafficking drugs. Cocaine use is associated with irregularities in placental blood flow, abruptio placentae, premature labor and delivery, and an increased prevalence of infants with very low birth weights.', '', 'Individuals with stimulant use disorder may become involved in theft, prostitution, or drug dealing in order to acquire drugs or money for drugs.', '', 'Neurocognitive impairment is common among methamphetamine users(Mooney et al. 2009; Scott et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2004). Oral health problems include “meth mouth” with gum disease, tooth decay, and mouth sores related to the toxic effects of smoking the drug and to bruxism while intoxicated(Shetty et al. 2010). Adverse pulmonary effects appear to be less common for amphetamine-type stimulants because they are smoked fewer times per day. Emergency department visits are common for stimulant-related mental disorder symptoms, injury, skin infections, and dental pathology(Hendrickson et al. 2008).', 'Primary mental disorders', '', 'Stimulant-induced disorders may resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) (for discussion of this differential diagnosis, see “Stimulant Withdrawal”). The mental disturbances resulting from the effects of stimulants should be distinguished from the symptoms of schizophrenia; depressive and bipolar disorders; generalized anxiety disorder; and panic disorder.', 'Phencyclidine intoxication', '', 'Intoxication with phencyclidine (“PCP” or “angel dust”) or synthetic “designer drugs” such as mephedrone (known by different names, including “bath salts”) may cause a similar clinical picture and can only be distinguished from stimulant intoxication by the presence of cocaine or amphetamine-type substance metabolites in a urine or plasma sample.', 'Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal', '', 'Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal are distinguished from the other stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.', 'Stimulant-related disorders often co-occur with other substance use disorders, especially those involving substances with sedative properties, which are often taken to reduce insomnia, nervousness, and other unpleasant side effects. Cocaine users often use alcohol, while amphetamine-type stimulant users often use cannabis. Stimulant use disorder may be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, antisocial personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and gambling disorder. Cardiopulmonary problems are often present in individuals seeking treatment for cocaine-related problems, with chest pain being the most common(Lange and Hillis 2001; Schwartz et al. 2010). Medical problems occur in response to adulterants used as “cutting” agents. Cocaine users who ingest cocaine cut with levamisole, an antimicrobial and veterinary medication, may experience agranulocytosis and febrile neutropenia(Chang et al. 2010; Marinetti 2009). ', '', '']
