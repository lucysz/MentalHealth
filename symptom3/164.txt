Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-like drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon), carbamates (e.g., glutethimide, meprobamate), barbiturates (e.g., secobarbital), and barbiturate-like hypnotics (e.g., glutethimide, methaqualone). This class of substances includes all prescription sleeping medications and almost all prescription antianxiety medications. Nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety agents (e.g., buspirone, gepirone) are not included in this class because they do not appear to be associated with significant misuse.', '', 'Like alcohol, these agents are brain depressants and can produce similar substance/medication-induced and substance use disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances are available both by prescription and illegally. Some individuals who obtain these substances by prescription will develop a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, while others who misuse these substances or use them for intoxication will not develop a use disorder. In particular, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with rapid onset and/or short to intermediate lengths of action may be taken for intoxication purposes, although longer acting substances in this class may be taken for intoxication as well(Licata and Rowlett 2008).', '', 'Craving (Criterion A4), either while using or during a period of abstinence, is a typical feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Misuse of substances from this class may occur on its own or in conjunction with use of other substances. For example, individuals may use intoxicating doses of sedatives or benzodiazepines to “come down” from cocaine or amphetamines or use high doses of benzodiazepines in combination with methadone to “boost” its effects(Iguchi et al. 1993).', '', 'Repeated absences or poor work performance, school absences, suspensions or expulsions, and neglect of children or household (Criterion A5) may be related to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, as may the continued use of the substances despite arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication or despite physical fights (Criterion A6). Limiting contact with family or friends, avoiding work or school, or stopping participation in hobbies, sports, or games (Criterion A7) and recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use when driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use (Criterion A8) are also seen in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder.', '', "Very significant levels of tolerance and withdrawal can develop to the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. There may be evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of a diagnosis of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder in an individual who has abruptly discontinued use of benzodiazepines that were taken for long periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses(O'Brien 2005). In these cases, an additional diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is made only if other criteria are met. That is, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications may be prescribed for appropriate medical purposes, and depending on the dose regimen, these drugs may then produce tolerance and withdrawal. If these drugs are prescribed or recommended for appropriate medical purposes, and if they are used as prescribed, the resulting tolerance or withdrawal does not meet the criteria for diagnosing a substance use disorder. However, it is necessary to determine whether the drugs were appropriately prescribed and used (e.g., falsifying medical symptoms to obtain the medication; using more medication than prescribed; obtaining the medication from several doctors without informing them of the others’ involvement).", 'Given the unidimensional nature of the symptoms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (Gillespie et al. 2007), severity is based on the number of criteria endorsed.Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is often associated with other substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, opioid, stimulant use disorders). Sedatives are often used to alleviate the unwanted effects of these other substances. With repeated use of the substance, tolerance develops to the sedative effects, and a progressively higher dose is used. However, tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly, and as the individual takes more substance to achieve euphoria or other desired effects, there may be a sudden onset of respiratory depression and hypotension, which may result in death. Intense or repeated sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be associated with severe depression that, although temporary, can lead to suicide attempt and completed suicide.', '', 'The 12-month prevalences of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder are estimated to be 0.3% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.2% among adults age 18 years and older(Compton et al. 2007; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011). Rates of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder are slightly greater among adult males (0.3%) than among adult females, but for 12- to 17-year-olds, the rate for females (0.4%) exceeds that for males (0.2%). The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder decreases as a function of age and is greatest among 18- to 29-year-olds (0.5%) and lowest among individuals 65 years and older (0.04%).', '', 'Twelve-month prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder varies across racial/ethnic subgroups of the U.S. population(Compton et al. 2007; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2011). For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are greatest among whites (0.3%) relative to African Americans (0.2%), Hispanics (0.2%), Native Americans (0.1%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.1%). Among adults, 12-month prevalence is greatest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.8%), with rates of approximately 0.2% among African Americans, whites, and Hispanics and 0.1% among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.', '', 'The usual course of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder involves individuals in their teens or 20s who escalate their occasional use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents to the point at which they develop problems that meet criteria for a diagnosis(Licata and Rowlett 2008). This pattern may be especially likely among individuals who have other substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol, opioids, stimulants). An initial pattern of intermittent use socially (e.g., at parties) can lead to daily use and high levels of tolerance. Once this occurs, an increasing level of interpersonal difficulties, as well as increasingly severe episodes of cognitive dysfunction and physiological withdrawal, can be expected.', '', 'The second and less frequently observed clinical course begins with an individual who originally obtained the medication by prescription from a physician, usually for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, or somatic complaints. As either tolerance or a need for higher doses of the medication develops, there is a gradual increase in the dose and frequency of self-administration. The individual is likely to continue to justify use on the basis of his or her original symptoms of anxiety or insomnia, but substance-seeking behavior becomes more prominent, and the individual may seek out multiple physicians to obtain sufficient supplies of the medication. Tolerance can reach high levels, and withdrawal (including seizures and withdrawal delirium) may occur.', '', 'As with many substance use disorders, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder generally has an onset during adolescence or early adult life. There is an increased risk for misuse and problems from many psychoactive substances as individuals age(Licata and Rowlett 2008). In particular, cognitive impairment increases as a side effect with age, and the metabolism of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics decreases with age among older individuals. Both acute and chronic toxic effects of these substances, especially effects on cognition, memory, and motor coordination, are likely to increase with age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic age-related changes. Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) are more likely to develop intoxication and impaired physiological functioning at lower doses.', '', 'Deliberate intoxication to achieve a “high” is most likely to be observed in teenagers and individuals in their 20s(Licata and Rowlett 2008). Problems associated with sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are also seen in individuals in their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed medications. In older individuals, intoxication can resemble a progressive dementia.', 'Impulsivity and novelty seeking are individual temperaments that relate to the propensity to develop a substance use disorder but may themselves be genetically determined. Since sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are all pharmaceuticals, a key risk factor relates to availability of the substances. In the United States, the historical patterns of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic misuse relate to the broad prescribing patterns. For instance, a marked decrease in prescription of barbiturates was associated with an increase in benzodiazepine prescribing. Peer factors may relate to genetic predisposition in terms of how individuals select their environment. Other individuals at heightened risk might include those with alcohol use disorder who may receive repeated prescriptions in response to their complaints of alcohol-related anxiety or insomnia.As for other substance use disorders, the risk for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder can be related to individual, family, peer, social, and environmental factors(Kendler et al. 2003; Tsuang et al. 1998). Within these domains, genetic factors play a particularly important role both directly and indirectly. Overall, across development, genetic factors seem to play a larger role in the onset of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder as individuals age through puberty into adult life. Early onset of use is associated with greater likelihood for developing a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder (McCabe et al. 2007).There are marked variations in prescription patterns (and availability) of this class of substances in different countries, which may lead to variations in prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders.Females may be at higher risk than males for prescription drug misuse of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.Almost all sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances can be identified through laboratory evaluations of urine or blood (the latter of which can quantify the amounts of these agents in the body). Urine tests are likely to remain positive for up to approximately 1 week after the use of long-acting substances, such as diazepam or flurazepam(Licata and Rowlett 2008).', '', 'The social and interpersonal consequences of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder mimic those of alcohol in terms of the potential for disinhibited behavior(Licata and Rowlett 2008). Accidents, interpersonal difficulties (such as arguments or fights), and interference with work or school performance are all common outcomes. Physical examination is likely to reveal evidence of a mild decrease in most aspects of autonomic nervous system functioning, including a slower pulse, a slightly decreased respiratory rate, and a slight drop in blood pressure (most likely to occur with postural changes). At high doses, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances can be lethal, particularly when mixed with alcohol, although the lethal dosage varies considerably among the specific substances. Overdoses may be associated with a deterioration in vital signs that signals an impending medical emergency (e.g., respiratory arrest from barbiturates). There may be consequences of trauma (e.g., internal bleeding or a subdural hematoma) from accidents that occur while intoxicated. Intravenous use of these substances can result in medical complications related to the use of contaminated needles (e.g., hepatitis and HIV).', '', 'Acute intoxication can result in accidental injuries and automobile accidents. For elderly individuals, even short-term use of these sedating medications at prescribed doses can be associated with an increased risk for cognitive problems and falls. The disinhibiting effects of these agents, like alcohol, may potentially contribute to overly aggressive behavior, with subsequent interpersonal and legal problems. Accidental or deliberate overdoses, similar to those observed for alcohol use disorder or repeated alcohol intoxication, can occur. In contrast to their wide margin of safety when used alone, benzodiazepines taken in combination with alcohol can be particularly dangerous, and accidental overdoses are reported commonly. Accidental overdoses have also been reported in individuals who deliberately misuse barbiturates and other nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (e.g., methaqualone), but since these agents are much less available than the benzodiazepines, the frequency of overdosing is low in most settings.', '', 'Other mental disorders or medical conditions', '', 'Individuals with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders may present with symptoms (e.g., anxiety) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder vs. sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal). The slurred speech, incoordination, and other associated features characteristic of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication could be the result of another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) or of a prior head trauma (e.g., a subdural hematoma).', 'Alcohol use disorder', '', 'Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder must be differentiated from alcohol use disorder.', 'Clinically appropriate use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications', '', "Individuals may continue to take benzodiazepine medication according to a physician’s direction for a legitimate medical indication over extended periods of time. Even if physiological signs of tolerance or withdrawal are manifested, many of these individuals do not develop symptoms that meet the criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder because they are not preoccupied with obtaining the substance and its use does not interfere with their performance of usual social or occupational roles(O'Brien 2005).", 'Nonmedical use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents is associated with alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and, generally, illicit drug use(Becker et al. 2007). There may also be an overlap between sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and antisocial personality disorder(Compton et al. 2005); depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders(Becker et al. 2007; Conway et al. 2006); and other substance use disorders, such as alcohol use disorder and illicit drug use disorders(McCabe et al. 2008). Antisocial behavior and antisocial personality disorder are especially associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder when the substances are obtained illegally.', '', '']
