['Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition', 'This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical condition. The unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific mental disorder due to another medical condition, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). This is done by recording the name of the disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition inserted in place of “another medical condition.” Furthermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must be listed immediately before the code for the unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as 345.40 (G40.209) complex partial seizures, 294.9 (F06.9) unspecified mental disorder due to complex partial seizures.
