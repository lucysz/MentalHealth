The most common type is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically referred to as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much rarer and is associated with transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also called “mad cow disease.”(Ironside 2012) Typically, individuals with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits, ataxia, and abnormal movements such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically, the history reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the disorder is typically seen only at the major level. However, many individuals with the disorder may have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of psychiatric symptoms, characterized a by low mood, withdrawal, and anxiety(Heath et al. 2010). Prion disease is typically not diagnosed without at least one of the characteristic biomarker features: recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial forms, family history or genetic testing. The annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases per million people(Ladogana et al. 2005). Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short survival.Prion disease may develop at any age in adults—the peak age for the sporadic CJD is approximately 67 years—although it has been reported to occur in individuals spanning the teenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may include fatigue, anxiety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration. After several weeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal gait or other movements that may be myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a rapidly progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses very rapidly to the major level of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can progress over 2 years and appear similar in its course to other NCDs.Cross-species transmission of prion infections, with agents that are closely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the mid-1990s). Transmission by corneal transplantation and by human growth factor injection has been documented, and anecdotal cases of transmission to health care workers have been reported.There is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases, associated with an autosomal dominant mutation(Brown and Mastrianni 2010).Prion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are no distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable biomarkers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as well as tau protein(Chohan et al. 2010). Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently considered the most sensitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multifocal gray matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions(Vitali et al. 2011). In some individuals, the electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous discharges at a rate of 0.5–2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder.', 'Other major neurocognitive disorders', '', 'Major NCD due to prion disease may appear similar in its course to other NCDs, but prion diseases are typically distinguished by their rapid progression and prominent cerebellar and motor symptoms.', '', '']
