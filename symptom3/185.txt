The disorder includes not only progressive cognitive impairment (with early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than learning and memory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (which can be a very early manifestation); as well as hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions. The symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no adequate underlying cause can be found(McKeith et al. 1996; McKeith et al. 1999; McKeith et al. 2005). The variable presentation of NCDLB symptoms reduces the likelihood of all symptoms being observed in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough assessment of caregiver observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to assess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core feature is spontaneous parkinsonism, which must begin after the onset of cognitive decline; by convention, major cognitive deficits are observed at least 1 year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must also be distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate diagnosis is essential to safe treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have severe sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used with extreme caution in managing the psychotic manifestations(McKeith et al. 1992).', '', 'The diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with the core or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of sufficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will often be insufficient evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the unspecified diagnosis is most appropriate.', 'Individuals with NCDLB frequently experience repeated falls and syncope and transient episodes of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic dysfunction, such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary incontinence, may be observed. Auditory and other nonvisual hallucinations are common, as are systematized delusions, delusional misidentification, and depression(McKeith et al. 2005).The few population-based prevalence estimates for NCDLB available range from 0.1% to 5% of the general elderly population, and from 1.7% to 30.5% of all dementia cases(Zaccai et al. 2005). In brain bank (autopsy) series, the pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in 20%–35% of cases of dementia(Ferman and Boeve 2007). The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1.5:1. NCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with insidious onset. However, there is often a prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated by illness or surgery. The distinction between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies are primarily cortical in location, and major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, in which the pathology is primarily in the basal ganglia, is the order in which the cognitive and motor symptoms emerge(Lippa et al. 2007). In NCDLB, the cognitive decline is manifested early in the course of illness, at least a year before the onset of motor symptoms (see the section “Differential Diagnosis” for this disorder). Disease course may be characterized by occasional plateaus but eventually progresses through severe dementia to death. Average duration of survival is 5–7 years in clinical series(McKeith et al. 2004). Onset of symptoms is typically observed from the sixth through the ninth decades of life, with most cases having their onset when affected individuals are in their mid-70s(McKeith et al. 2005).Familial aggregation may occur, and several risk genes have been identified(McKeith et al. 2005), but in most cases of NCDLB, there is no family history.The underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily a synucleinopathy due to alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation. Cognitive testing beyond the use of a brief screening instrument may be necessary to define deficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to measure fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sleep behavior disorder may be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or identified by questioning the patient or informant about relevant symptoms. Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) is not recommended as a diagnostic marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A diagnostically suggestive feature is low striatal dopamine transporter uptake on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Other clinically useful markers potentially include relative preservation of medial temporal structures on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan; reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT/PET scan; generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion scan with reduced occipital activity; abnormal (low uptake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy suggesting sympathetic denervation; and prominent slow-wave activity on the electroencephalogram with temporal lobe transient waves(McKeith et al. 2000; McKeith et al. 2005).Individuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be expected for their cognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. This is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments, which cause problems with toileting, transferring, and eating(McKeith et al. 2006). Sleep disorders and prominent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties. Consequently, the quality of life of individuals with NCDLB is often significantly worse than that of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.', 'Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Parkinson’s disease', '', 'A key differentiating feature in clinical diagnosis is the temporal sequence in which the parkinsonism and the NCD appear. For NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, the individual must develop cognitive decline in the context of established Parkinson’s disease; by convention, the decline should not reach the stage of major NCD until at least 1 year after Parkinson’s is diagnosed. If less than a year has passed since the onset of motor symptoms, the diagnosis is NCDLB(Lippa et al. 2007; McKeith et al. 2004; McKeith et al. 2005). This distinction is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD level.', '', 'The timing and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be more difficult to determine because the onset and clinical presentation can be ambiguous, and unspecified mild NCD should be diagnosed if the other core and suggestive features are absent.', 'Lewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease pathology, particularly among the oldest age groups. In Alzheimer’s disease, there is concomitant synuclein pathology in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are included)(McKeith et al. 2005). In general, there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in individuals with dementia than in older individuals without dementia. ', '', '']
