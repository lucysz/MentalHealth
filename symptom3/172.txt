Examples of these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. Tobacco use disorder is common among individuals who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco daily(Hughes et al. 2006) and is uncommon among individuals who do not use tobacco daily or who use nicotine medications(Shiffman et al. 2003). Tolerance to tobacco is exemplified by the disappearance of nausea and dizziness after repeated intake and with a more intense effect of tobacco the first time it is used during the day. Cessation of tobacco use can produce a well-defined withdrawal syndrome(Hughes 2007). Many individuals with tobacco use disorder use tobacco to relieve or to avoid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., after being in a situation where use is restricted). Many individuals who use tobacco have tobacco-related physical symptoms or diseases and continue to smoke. The large majority report craving when they do not smoke for several hours(Hughes 2007). Spending excessive time using tobacco can be exemplified by chain-smoking (i.e., smoking one cigarette after another with no time between cigarettes). Because tobacco sources are readily and legally available, and because nicotine intoxication is very rare, spending a great deal of time attempting to procure tobacco or recovering from its effects is uncommon. Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities can occur when an individual forgoes an activity because it occurs in tobacco use–restricted areas. Use of tobacco rarely results in failure to fulfill major role obligations (e.g., interference with work, interference with home obligations), but persistent social or interpersonal problems (e.g., having arguments with others about tobacco use, avoiding social situations because of others’ disapproval of tobacco use) or use that is physically hazardous (e.g., smoking in bed, smoking around flammable chemicals) occur at an intermediate prevalence. Although these criteria are less often endorsed by tobacco users, if endorsed, they can indicate a more severe disorder(Shmulewitz et al. 2011).Smoking within 30 minutes of waking, smoking daily, smoking more cigarettes per day, and waking at night to smoke are associated with tobacco use disorder (Baker et al. 2012; Piper et al. 2006). Environmental cues can evoke craving and withdrawal. Serious medical conditions, such as lung and other cancers, cardiac and pulmonary disease, perinatal problems, cough, shortness of breath, and accelerated skin aging, often occur(National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2004).', '', 'Cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product(Giovino 2007), representing over 90% of tobacco/nicotine use. In the United States, 57% of adults have never been smokers, 22% are former smokers, and 21% are current smokers(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011). Approximately 20% of current U.S. smokers are nondaily smokers(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011). The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use is less than 5%, and the prevalence of tobacco use in pipes and cigars is less than 1%(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011; Giovino 2007).', '', 'DSM-IV nicotine dependence criteria can be used to estimate the prevalence of tobacco use disorder, but since they are a subset of tobacco use disorder criteria, the prevalence of tobacco use disorder will be somewhat greater. The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV nicotine dependence in the United States is 13% among adults age 18 years and older(Grant et al. 2004). Rates are similar among adult males (14%) and females (12%) and decline in age from 17% among 18- to 29-year-olds to 4% among individuals age 65 years and older(Grant et al. 2004). The prevalence of current nicotine dependence is greater among Native American and Alaska Natives (23%) than among whites (14%) but is less among African Americans (10%), Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (6%), and Hispanics (6%)(Grant et al. 2004). The prevalence among current daily smokers is approximately 50%(Hughes et al. 2006).', 'In many developing nations, the prevalence of smoking is much greater in males than in females, but this is not the case in developed nations(Wipfli and Samet 2009). However, there often is a lag in the demographic transition such that smoking increases in females at a later time(Wipfli and Samet 2009)The majority of U.S. adolescents experiment with tobacco use, and by age 18 years, about 20% smoke at least monthly. Most of these individuals become daily tobacco users(Giovino 2007). Initiation of smoking after age 21 years is rare. In general, some of the tobacco use disorder criteria symptoms occur soon after beginning tobacco use(DiFranza 2008), and many individuals’ pattern of use meets current tobacco use disorder criteria by late adolescence(Giovino 2007). More than 80% of individuals who use tobacco attempt to quit at some time, but 60% relapse within 1 week and less than 5% remain abstinent for life(Hughes et al. 2004). However, most individuals who use tobacco make multiple attempts such that one-half of tobacco users eventually abstain(Giovino 2007). Individuals who use tobacco who do quit usually do not do so until after age 30 years. Although nondaily smoking in the United States was previously rare, it has become more prevalent in the last decade, especially among younger individuals who use tobacco. Individuals with externalizing personality traits are more likely to initiate tobacco use(Ziedonis et al. 2008). Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or conduct disorder, and adults with depressive, bipolar, anxiety, personality, psychotic, or other substance use disorders, are at higher risk of starting and continuing tobacco use and of tobacco use disorder (Ziedonis et al. 2008).Individuals with low incomes and low educational levels are more likely to initiate tobacco use and are less likely to stop(Giovino 2007).Genetic factors contribute to the onset of tobacco use, the continuation of tobacco use, and the development of tobacco use disorder, with a degree of heritability equivalent to that observed with other substance use disorders (i.e., about 50%)(Munafò et al. 2004). Some of this risk is specific to tobacco, and some is common with the vulnerability to developing any substance use disorder. Cultures and subcultures vary widely in their acceptance of the use of tobacco. The prevalence of tobacco use declined in the United States from the 1960s through the 1990s, but this decrease has been less evident in African American and Hispanic populations(Giovino 2007). Also, smoking in developing countries is more prevalent than in developed nations(Wipfli and Samet 2009). The degree to which these cultural differences are due to income, education, and tobacco control activities in a country is unclear(Giovino 2007; World Health Organization 2008). Non-Hispanic white smokers appear to be more likely to develop tobacco use disorder than are smokers(Giovino 2007). Some ethnic differences may be biologically based(Mickens et al. 2010). African American males tend to have higher nicotine blood levels for a given number of cigarettes, and this might contribute to greater difficulty in quitting. Also, the speed of nicotine metabolism is significantly different for whites compared with African Americans and can vary by genotypes associated with ethnicities.Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its metabolite cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine, can be used to measure the extent of current tobacco or nicotine use; however, these are only weakly related to tobacco use disorder (SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification 2002).', 'Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder', '', 'Medical consequences of tobacco use often begin when tobacco users are in their 40s and usually become progressively more debilitating over time(National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2004). One-half of smokers who do not stop using tobacco will die early from a tobacco-related illness, and smoking-related morbidity occurs in more than one-half of tobacco users. Most medical conditions result from exposure to carbon monoxide, tars, and other non-nicotine components of tobacco. The major predictor of reversibility is duration of smoking. Secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. Long-term use of nicotine medications does not appear to cause medical harm(Shields 2011).', 'The most common medical diseases from smoking are cardiovascular illnesses, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers(National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2004). Smoking also increases perinatal problems, such as low birth weight and miscarriage(National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 2004). The most common psychiatric comorbidities are alcohol/substance, depressive, bipolar, anxiety, personality, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (Ziedonis et al. 2008). In individuals with current tobacco use disorder, the prevalence of current alcohol, drug, anxiety, depressive, bipolar, and personality disorders ranges from 22% to 32%(Grant et al. 2004). Nicotine-dependent smokers are 2.7–8.1 times more likely to have these disorders than nondependent smokers, never-smokers, or ex-smokers.', '', '']
