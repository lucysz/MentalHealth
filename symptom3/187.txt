Traumatic brain injury is defined as brain trauma with specific characteristics that include at least one of the following: loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs (e.g., positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis) (Criterion B). To be attributable to TBI, the NCD must present either immediately after the brain injury occurs or immediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past the acute post-injury period (Criterion C).', '', 'The cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive ability, learning, and memory are common as well as slowing in speed of information processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more severe TBI in which there is brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or penetrating injury, there may be additional neurocognitive deficits, such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional dyspraxia.', 'Major or mild NCD due to TBI may be accompanied by disturbances in emotional function (e.g., irritability, easy frustration, tension and anxiety, affective lability); personality changes (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, suspiciousness, aggression); physical disturbances (e.g., headache, fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or hyperacusis, photosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic medications); and, particularly in more severe TBI, neurological symptoms and signs (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis, visual disturbances, cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic injuries.', '', 'In the United States, 1.7 million TBIs occur annually, resulting in 1.4 million emergency department visits, 275,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths. About 2% of the population lives with TBI-associated disability. Males account for 59% of TBIs in the United States. The most common etiologies of TBI in the United States are falls, vehicular accidents, and being struck on the head. Collisions and blows to the head that occur in the course of contact sports are increasingly recognized as sources of mild TBI, with a concern that repeated mild TBI may have cumulatively persisting sequelae(McAllister et al. 2012).', '', 'The severity of a TBI is rated at the time of injury/initial assessment as mild, moderate, or severe according to the thresholds in Table.', '', 'The severity rating of the TBI itself does not necessarily correspond to the severity of the resulting NCD. The course of recovery from TBI is variable, depending not only on the specifics of the injury but also on cofactors, such as age, prior history of brain damage, or substance abuse, that may favor or impede recovery.', '', 'Neurobehavioral symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate aftermath of the TBI. Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical course is that of complete or substantial improvement in associated neurocognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with mild TBI tend to resolve within days to weeks after the injury with complete resolution typical by 3 months(Institute of Medicine 2008; Rohling et al. 2011). Other symptoms that may potentially co-occur with the neurological symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability, fatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep disturbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks following mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger consideration of additional diagnoses(McCrea et al. 2009; Vasterling and Dikmen 2012). However, repeated mild TBI may be associated with persisting neurocognitive disturbance(McAllister et al. 2012).', '', 'With moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of neurocognitive deficits, there may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and behavioral complications(Institute of Medicine 2008). These include seizures (particularly in the first year), photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritability, aggression, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume occupational and social functioning at pre-injury level, and deterioration in interpersonal relationships. Moderate and severe TBI have been associated with increased risk of depression, aggression, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.', '', 'The features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by age, specifics of the injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related impairment in an infant or child may be reflected in delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse academic performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older teenagers and adults, persisting symptoms may include various neurocognitive deficits, irritability, hypersensitivity to light and sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including depression, anxiety, hostility, or apathy. In older individuals with depleted cognitive reserve, mild TBI is more likely to result in incomplete recoveries.', 'Risk factors for traumatic brain injury', '', 'Traumatic brain injury rates vary by age, with the highest prevalence among individuals younger than 4 years, older adolescents, and individuals older than 65 years. Falls are the most common cause of TBI, with motor vehicle accidents being second. Sports concussions are frequent causes of TBI in older children, teenagers, and young adults.', 'Risk factors for neurocognitive disorder after traumatic brain injury', '', 'Repeated concussions can lead to persistent NCD and neuropathological evidence of traumatic encephalopathy(Baugh et al. 2012). Co-occurring intoxication with a substance may increase the severity of a TBI from a motor vehicle accident, but whether intoxication at the time of injury worsens neurocognitive outcome is unknown.', 'Course modifiers', '', 'Mild TBI generally resolves within a few weeks to months(Rohling et al. 2011), although resolution may be delayed or incomplete in the context of repeated TBI. Worse outcome from moderate to severe TBI is associated with older age (older than 40 years) and initial clinical parameters, such as low Glasgow Coma Scale score; worse motor function; pupillary nonreactivity; and computed tomography (CT) evidence of brain injury (e.g., petechial hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhage, midline shift, obliteration of third ventricle).', 'Beyond neuropsychological testing, CT scanning may reveal petechial hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or evidence of contusion. Magnetic resonance image scanning may also reveal hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages. With mild NCD due to TBI, individuals may report reduced cognitive efficiency, difficulty concentrating, and lessened ability to perform usual activities. With major NCD due to TBI, an individual may have difficulty in independent living and self-care. Prominent neuromotor features, such as severe incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing, may be present in major NCD due to TBI and may add to functional difficulties. Individuals with TBI histories report more depressive symptoms, and these can amplify cognitive complaints and worsen functional outcome(Kim et al. 2007). Additionally, loss of emotional control, including aggressive or inappropriate affect and apathy, may be present after more severe TBI with greater neurocognitive impairment. These features may compound difficulties with independent living and self-care.In some instances, severity of neurocognitive symptoms may appear to be inconsistent with the severity of the TBI. After previously undetected neurological complications (e.g., chronic hematoma) are excluded, the possibility of diagnoses such as somatic symptom disorder or factitious disorder need to be considered. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can co-occur with the NCD and have overlapping symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, aggressive behavioral disinhibition).Among individuals with substance use disorders, the neurocognitive effects of the substance contribute to or compound the TBI-associated neurocognitive change. Some symptoms associated with TBI may overlap with symptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two disorders may co-occur, especially in military populations. ', '', '']
