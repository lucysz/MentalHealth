(Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.)', '', '    The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).', 'If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of at least two symptomatic cycles, “provisional” should be noted after the name of the diagnosis (i.e., “premenstrual dysphoric disorder, provisional”).', '', 'The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are the expression of mood lability, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the premenstrual phase of the cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter. These symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms. Symptoms must have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social functioning. The intensity and/or expressivity of the accompanying symptoms may be closely related to social and cultural background characteristics of the affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as religious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues.', '', 'Typically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses(Hartlage et al. 2012). Although it is not uncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few days of menses, the individual must have a symptom-free period in the follicular phase after the menstrual period begins. While the core symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic symptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of physical and/or behavioral symptoms in the absence of mood and/or anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but not duration) to those of another mental disorder, such as a major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder. In order to confirm a provisional diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required for at least two symptomatic cycles.', 'Delusions and hallucinations have been described in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle but are rare(Severino and Yonkers 1993). The premenstrual phase has been considered by some to be a risk period for suicide(Baca-Garcia et al. 2004; Saunders and Hawton 2006). Twelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is between 1.8% and 5.8% of menstruating women(Gehlert et al. 2009; Wittchen et al. 2002). Estimates are substantially inflated if they are based on retrospective reports rather than prospective daily ratings. However, estimated prevalence based on a daily record of symptoms for 1–2 months may be less representative, as individuals with the most severe symptoms may be unable to sustain the rating process. The most rigorous estimate of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is 1.8% for women whose symptoms meet the full criteria without functional impairment and 1.3% for women whose symptoms meet the current criteria with functional impairment and without co-occurring symptoms from another mental disorder(Gehlert et al. 2009). Onset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can occur at any point after menarche. Incidence of new cases over a 40-month follow-up period is 2.5% (95% confidence interval = 1.7–3.7)(Wittchen et al. 2002). Anecdotally, many individuals, as they approach menopause, report that symptoms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopause, although cyclical hormone replacement can trigger the re-expression of symptoms.', 'Environmental', '', 'Environmental factors associated with the expression of premenstrual dysphoric disorder include stress(Deuster et al. 1999; Girdler et al. 2004), history of interpersonal trauma(Girdler et al. 2004), seasonal changes(Maskall et al. 1997), and sociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior in general, and female gender role in particular.', 'Genetic and physiological', '', 'Heritability of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown. However, for premenstrual symptoms, estimates for heritability range between 30% and 80%, with the most stable component of premenstrual symptoms estimated to be about 50% heritable(Kendler et al. 1998).', 'Course modifiers', '', 'Women who use oral contraceptives may have fewer premenstrual complaints than do women who do not use oral contraceptives.', 'Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not a culture-bound syndrome and has been observed in individuals in the United States, Europe(Fontana and Palfai 1994; Wittchen et al. 2002), India(Banerjee et al. 2000), and Asia(Takeda et al. 2006). It is unclear as to whether rates differ by race(Pilver et al. 2011; Stout et al. 1986). Nevertheless, frequency, intensity, and expressivity of symptoms and help-seeking patterns may be significantly influenced by cultural factors.As indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is appropriately confirmed by 2 months of prospective symptom ratings. A number of scales, including the Daily Rating of Severity of Problems(Endicott et al. 2006) and the Visual Analogue Scales for Premenstrual Mood Symptoms(Steiner and Streiner 2005), have undergone validation and are commonly used in clinical trials for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Rating Scale has a self-report and an observer version, both of which have been validated(Steiner et al. 2011) and used widely to measure illness severity in women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder.Symptoms must be associated with clinically meaningful distress and/or an obvious and marked impairment in the ability to function socially or occupationally in the week prior to menses. Impairment in social functioning may be manifested by marital discord and problems with children, other family members, or friends. Chronic marital or job problems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in association with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.', 'Premenstrual syndrome', '', 'Premenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric disorder in that a minimum of five symptoms is not required, and there is no stipulation of affective symptoms for individuals who have premenstrual syndrome. This condition may be more common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder, although the estimated prevalence of premenstrual syndrome varies. While premenstrual syndrome shares the feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, it is generally considered to be less severe than premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The presence of physical or behavioral symptoms in the premenstruum, without the required affective symptoms, likely meets criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.', 'Dysmenorrhea', '', 'Dysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a syndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin with the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by definition, begin before the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses.', 'Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)', '', 'Many women with (either naturally occurring or substance/medication-induced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder believe that they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms, they realize that the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Women with another mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or intermittent symptoms that are unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. However, because the onset of menses constitutes a memorable event, they may report that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum or that symptoms worsen premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement that symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings(Rubinow et al. 1984). The process of differential diagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on retrospective symptoms only, is made more difficult because of the overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and some other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for differentiating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive episodes, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and borderline personality disorder. However, the rate of personality disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric disorder than in those without the disorder.', 'Use of hormonal treatments', '', 'Some women who present with moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contraceptives. If such symptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms may be due to the use of hormones rather than to the underlying condition of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear, this is consistent with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.', 'A major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals presenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (Pearlstein et al. 1990). A wide range of medical (e.g., migraine, asthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in the premenstrual phase; however, the absence of a symptom-free period during the postmenstrual interval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions are better considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental or medical disorder(Hartlage et al. 2004). Although the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situations in which an individual only experiences a premenstrual exacerbation of another mental or physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another mental or physical disorder if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of functioning that are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different from the symptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.
