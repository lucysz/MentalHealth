['Other Specified Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurodevelopmental disorder that cause impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified neurodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording “other specified neurodevelopmental disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure”).', 'An example of a presentation that can be specified using the “other specified” designation is the following: Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure: Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is characterized by a range of developmental disabilities following exposure to alcohol in utero.', '']
