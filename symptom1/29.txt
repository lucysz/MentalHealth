The catatonia specifier is appropriate when the clinical picture is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance and involves at least three of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Criterion A. Catatonia is typically diagnosed in an inpatient setting and occurs in up to 35% of individuals with schizophrenia, but the majority of catatonia cases involve individuals with depressive or bipolar disorders(Kruger and Bräunig 2000; Kruger et al. 2003; Stompe et al. 2002; Ungvari et al. 2005; Wender et al. 2008). Before the catatonia specifier is used in neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or other mental disorders, a wide variety of other medical conditions need to be ruled out; these conditions include, but are not limited to, medical conditions due to infectious, metabolic, or neurological conditions (see “Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition”). Catatonia can also be a side effect of a medication (see the chapter “Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication”). Because of the seriousness of the complications, particular attention should be paid to the possibility that the catatonia is attributable to 333.92 (G21.0) neuroleptic malignant syndrome.', '']
