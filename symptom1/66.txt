The other medical condition should be coded and listed separately immediately before the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 438.89 [I69.398] cerebral infarction; 294.8 [F06.8] obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to cerebral infarction).', 'The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition is clinically significant obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms that are judged to be best explained as the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. Symptoms can include prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not made if the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E).', '', 'In determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are attributable to another medical condition, a relevant medical condition must be present. Furthermore, it must be established that obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms can be etiologically related to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism and that this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms and the medical condition is etiological, considerations that may provide some guidance in making this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g., striatal damage) causes obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the disturbance cannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another mental disorder.', '', 'There is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham’s chorea is the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever, which is in turn due to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham’s chorea is characterized by a combination of motor and nonmotor features. Nonmotor features include obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit, and emotional lability(Mercadante et al. 2000; Swedo et al. 1993). Although individuals with Sydenham’s chorea may present with non-neuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever, such as carditis and arthritis, they may present with obsessive-compulsive disorder–like symptoms; such individuals should be diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition.', '', 'Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been identified as another post-infectious autoimmune disorder characterized by the sudden onset of obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied by a variety of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of chorea, carditis, or arthritis, after Group A streptococcal infection(Swedo et al. 2004). Although there is a body of evidence that supports the existence of PANDAS, it remains a controversial diagnosis. Given this ongoing controversy, the description of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate etiological factors and to designate an expanded clinical entity: pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS), which deserves further study(Singer et al. 2012; Swedo et al. 2012).', 'A number of other medical disorders are known to include obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms as a manifestation. Examples include disorders leading to striatal damage, such as cerebral infarction.The development and course of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness. Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of another medical condition.', 'Delirium', '', 'A separate diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the dementia and if obsessive-compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of the clinical presentation.', 'Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms)', '', 'If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.', 'Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders', '', 'If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. When a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is being diagnosed in relation to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used.', 'Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (primary)', '', 'Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. In primary mental disorders, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demonstrated.
