['Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder', 'This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording “other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “body-focused repetitive behavior disorder”).', '', 'Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:', '', '    Body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws: This is similar to body dysmorphic disorder except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clearly observable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than “slight”).
