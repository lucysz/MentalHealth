Traumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent personal assault (e.g., sexual violence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical and/or sexual violence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or humanmade disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e.g., severe motor vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events may include inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe and traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjustment disorder but not to acute stress disorder.', '', 'The clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically involves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to the traumatic event(Bryant 2011b). In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can predominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or physiological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a strong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggressive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the traumatic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur immediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for acute stress disorder.', '', 'Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a result of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may also include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involving one’s child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited to close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental—death due to natural causes does not qualify—and include violent personal assault, suicide, serious accident, or serious injury(Bryant et al. 2011b). The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this disorder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase(Classen et al. 1998; Elklit and Christiansen 2010).', '', 'The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). The recollections are spontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response to a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring car triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory (e.g., sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experiencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., experiencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components.', '', 'Distressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a motor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars generally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in ways other than combat.)', '', 'Dissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experiencing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a traumatic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure are considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments (e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during play in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks, are typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present rather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress.', '', 'Some individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself, but instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when they are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or female who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a sense of heat for a burn victim, dizziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e.g., happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexuality) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame.', '', 'Alterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g., seeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of one’s surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things in a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals also report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was presumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not attributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.', '', 'Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse to discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions (e.g., excessive alcohol use when reminded of the experience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of the traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or avoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience.', '', 'It is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems with sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with generalized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat potentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., fear of having a heart attack)(Smith and Bryant 2000; Warda and Bryant 1998). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., the individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing). ', 'Individuals with acute stress disorder commonly engage in catastrophic or extremely negative thoughts about their role in the traumatic event, their response to the traumatic experience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual with acute stress disorder may feel excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or about not adapting to the experience more successfully(Ehlers et al. 2003; Warda and Bryant 1998). Individuals with acute stress disorder may also interpret their symptoms in a catastrophic manner, such that flashback memories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental capacity(Dunmore et al. 2001; Smith and Bryant 2000). It is common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks in the initial month after trauma exposure that may be triggered by trauma reminders or may apparently occur spontaneously(Bryant and Panasetis 2001; Nixon and Bryant 2003). Additionally, individuals with acute stress disorder may display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example, individuals may drive recklessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble excessively. In children, there may be significant separation anxiety, possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention from caregivers. In the case of bereavement following a death that occurred in traumatic circumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can involve acute grief reactions. In such cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, and arousal symptoms may involve reactions to the loss, such as intrusive memories of the circumstances of the individual’s death, disbelief that the individual has died, and anger about the death. Postconcussive symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits), which occur frequently following mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in individuals with acute stress disorder (Bryant 2011a). Postconcussive symptoms are equally common in brain-injured and non–brain-injured populations, and the frequent occurrence of postconcussive symptoms could be attributable to acute stress disorder symptoms(Meares et al. 2008). The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed populations (i.e., within 1 month of trauma exposure) varies according to the nature of the event and the context in which it is assessed. In both U.S. and non-U.S. populations, acute stress disorder tends to be identified in less than 20% of cases following traumatic events that do not involve interpersonal assault; 13%–21% of motor vehicle accidents(Harvey and Bryant 1998c; Holeva et al. 2001), 14% of mild traumatic brain injury(Harvey and Bryant 1998a), 19% of assault(Brewin et al. 1999), 10% of severe burns(Harvey and Bryant 1999a), and 6%–12% of industrial accidents(Creamer and Manning 1998; Harvey and Bryant 1999a). Higher rates (i.e., 20%–50%) are reported following interpersonal traumatic events, including assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting(Classen et al. 1998; Elklit and Christiansen 2010).', '', 'Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic event. Although acute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month, it may also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure and does not result in PTSD (Bryant et al. 2011b). Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop PTSD initially present with acute stress disorder (Bryant 2011b). Symptom worsening during the initial month can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or further traumatic events(Bryant and Harvey 1996; Solomon et al. 1996).', '', 'The forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults or adolescents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects aspects of the trauma (e.g., waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable to relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and younger are more likely than older children to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who survived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typically report a range of emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and even excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although children may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with reminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid going outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog).', 'Temperamental', '', 'Risk factors include prior mental disorder, high levels of negative affectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived severity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant coping style(Barton et al. 1996; Harvey and Bryant 1998b; Harvey and Bryant 1999b). Catastrophic appraisals of the traumatic experience, often characterized by exaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of acute stress disorder (Smith and Bryant 2000; Warda and Bryant 1998).', 'Environmental', '', 'First and foremost, an individual must be exposed to a traumatic event to be at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk factors for the disorder include a history of prior trauma(Barton et al. 1996; Harvey and Bryant 1998b; Harvey and Bryant 1999b).', 'Genetic and physiological', '', 'Females are at greater risk for developing acute stress disorder (Barton et al. 1996; Harvey and Bryant 1998b; Harvey and Bryant 1999b).', '', 'Elevated reactivity, as reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to trauma exposure increases the risk for developing acute stress disorder (Guthrie and Bryant 2005).', 'The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly with respect to dissociative symptoms, nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups may display variants of dissociative responses, such as possession or trancelike behaviors in the initial month after trauma exposure(Kirmayer 1996). Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress disorder among Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl attacks, and ataque de nervios among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic exposure(Hinton and Lewis-Fernández). ', 'Acute stress disorder is more prevalent among females than among males. Sex-linked neurobiological differences in stress response may contribute to females’ increased risk for acute stress disorder (Adreano and Cahill 2009; Bryant et al. 2011a). The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in part to a greater likelihood of exposure to the types of traumatic events with a high conditional risk for acute stress disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence. Impaired functioning in social, interpersonal, or occupational domains has been shown across survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who develop acute stress disorder. The extreme levels of anxiety that may be associated with acute stress disorder may interfere with sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress disorder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as potentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoidance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work.', 'Adjustment disorders', '', 'In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the criteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pattern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired)(Strain and Friedman 2011). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include some acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment disorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms and may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appropriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an adjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder.', 'Panic disorder', '', 'Spontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder (Bryant and Panasetis 2001; Nixon and Bryant 2003). However, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is anxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of dire consequences of the attacks.', 'Dissociative disorders', '', 'Severe dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization disorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated.', 'Posttraumatic stress disorder', '', 'Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event and resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and meet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD.', 'Obsessive-compulsive disorder', '', 'In obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent.', 'Psychotic disorders', '', 'Flashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a delirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to another medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these other perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by occurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features.', 'Traumatic brain injury', '', 'When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and traumatic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently(Stein and McAllister 2009). Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non–brain injured populations, including individuals with acute stress disorder (Meares et al. 2008). Because symptoms of acute stress disorder and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between acute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder . Furthermore, differential is aided by the fact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma exposure.', '', '']
