This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may occur during persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major depressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder as well as major depressive disorder.', '', 'Individuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or “down in the dumps.” During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from Criterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s day-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e.g., “I’ve always been this way”), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months (Criterion C).', 'Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive episode. The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approximately 0.5% for persistent depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive disorder(Blanco et al. 2010).', '', 'Persistent depressive disorder often has an early(Mondimore et al. 2006) and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood, adolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals with both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covariance of the corresponding features over time suggests the operation of a common mechanism(Klein and Schwartz 2002). Early onset (i.e., before age 21 years) is associated with a higher likelihood of comorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders(Garyfallos et al. 1999; Klein et al. 1999).', '', 'When symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to subsequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less likely to resolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive disorder than they are in a major depressive episode(Klein et al. 2000; Rhebergen et al. 2009).', 'Temperamental', '', 'Factors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include higher levels of neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning(Hayden and Klein 2001; Rhebergen et al. 2009; Wells et al. 1992), and presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder(Blanco et al. 2010).', 'Environmental', '', 'Childhood risk factors include parental loss or separation(Blanco et al. 2010).', 'Genetic and physiological', '', 'There are no clear differences in illness development, course, or family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disorder(Klein et al. 2004; McCullough et al. 2000; McCullough et al. 2003; Yang and Dunner 2001). Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to persistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that individuals with persistent depressive disorder will have a higher proportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive disorder than do individuals with major depressive disorder (Akiskal et al. 1981; Klein et al. 2004; Mondimore et al. 2006; Scott et al. 1988), and more depressive disorders in general(Klein et al. 2004).', '', 'A number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, hippocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive disorder(Hasler and Northoff 2011; Ravindran et al. 2009).

The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration, which distinguishes it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this period, then the diagnosis of major depression should be made and also noted as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the individual’s symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the specifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode” would be made. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and remains present, then the specifier “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. When full major depressive episode criteria are not currently met but there has been at least one previous episode of major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depressive symptoms, then the specifier of “with intermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode” is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depression in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used.', 'Psychotic disorders', '', 'Depressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder).

The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on history, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct pathophysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g., persistent depressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).', 'Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder', '', 'A substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persistent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.', 'Personality disorders', '', 'Often, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance. When an individual’s presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disorder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given.', 'In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent depressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety disorders and substance use disorders in particular(Blanco et al. 2010; Klein et al. 2004; Mondimore et al. 2006; Weissman et al. 1988a; Weissman et al. 1988b).
