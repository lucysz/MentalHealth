This overly familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made before children are developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social engagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays, especially cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor care. However, signs of the disorder often persist even after these other signs of neglect are no longer present(Chisholm 1998; O'Connor and Rutter 2000). Therefore, it is not uncommon for children with the disorder to present with no current signs of neglect(Boris et al. 2004; Rutter et al. 2009). Moreover, the condition can present in children who show no signs of disordered attachment(Gleason et al. 2011; O'Connor et al. 2003). Thus, disinhibited social engagement disorder may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or whose attachments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure. The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown. Nevertheless, the disorder appears to be rare, occurring in a minority of children, even those who have been severely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such high-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of children(Gleason et al. 2011). The condition is seen rarely in other clinical settings.", '', 'Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diagnosed with disinhibited social engagement disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed(Zeanah et al. 2005). However, there is no evidence that neglect beginning after age 2 years is associated with manifestations of the disorder(Wolkind 1974). If neglect occurs early and signs of the disorder appear, clinical features of the disorder are moderately stable over time, particularly if conditions of neglect persist(Gleason et al. 2011). Indiscriminate social behavior and lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults in toddlerhood are accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors in preschoolers(Tizard and Hodges 1978; Tizard and Rees 1975; Zeanah et al. 2005). When the disorder persists into middle childhood, clinical features manifest as verbal and physical overfamiliarity as well as inauthentic expression of emotions(Gleason et al. 2011; Rutter et al. 2009). These signs appear particularly apparent when the child interacts with adults. Peer relationships are most affected in adolescence, with both indiscriminate behavior and conflicts apparent(Hodges and Tizard 1989). The disorder has not been described in adults.', '', 'Disinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from the second year of life through adolescence. There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder from early childhood through adolescence. At the youngest ages, across many cultures, children show reticence when interacting with strangers(van Ijzendoorn and Sagi-Schwartz 2009). Young children with the disorder fail to show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool children, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by attention-seeking behavior(Tizard and Rees 1975; Zeanah et al. 2002; Zeanah et al. 2005). Verbal and physical overfamiliarity continue through middle childhood, accompanied by inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indiscriminate behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with the disorder have more “superficial” peer relationships and more peer conflicts. Adult manifestations of the disorder are unknown.', 'Environmental', '', 'Serious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for disinhibited social engagement disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the majority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Neurobiological vulnerability may differentiate neglected children who do and do not develop the disorder(Drury et al. 2012). However, no clear link with any specific neurobiological factors has been established. The disorder has not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after age 2 years. Prognosis is only modestly associated with quality of the caregiving environment following serious neglect(Gleason et al. 2011; Smyke et al. 2012). In many cases, the disorder persists, even in children whose caregiving environment becomes markedly improved.', 'Course modifiers', '', 'Caregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited social engagement disorder. Nevertheless, even after placement in normative caregiving environments, some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through adolescence(Hodges and Tizard 1989; Rutter et al. 2007).', 'Disinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers(Gleason et al. 2011; Hodges and Tizard 1989).', 'Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder', '', 'Because of social impulsivity that sometimes accompanies attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is necessary to differentiate the two disorders. Children with disinhibited social engagement disorder may be distinguished from those with ADHD because the former do not show difficulties with attention or hyperactivity.', 'Limited research has examined the issue of disorders comorbid with disinhibited social engagement disorder. Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and stereotypies, may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement disorder. In addition, children may be diagnosed with ADHD and disinhibited social engagement disorder concurrently. ', '', '']
