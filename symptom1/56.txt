Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced anxiety disorder.', ' Specify if (see Table in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):', '', '    With onset during intoxication: This specifier applies if criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.', '', '    With onset during withdrawal: This specifier applies if criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.', '', '    With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.', 'The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.', '', 'The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.89 methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; 292.89 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use).', '', 'The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used.', '', 'When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use).', '', 'The essential features of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symptoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a withdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the panic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to a month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of withdrawal). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be given if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/medication intoxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i.e., usually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered.', '', 'The substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.', 'Panic or anxiety can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimulants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and analgesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid preparations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, antipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g., organophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile substances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms.The prevalence of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is not clear. General population data suggest that it may be rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately 0.002%(Grant et al. 2004). However, in clinical populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher. Laboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intoxication as part of an assessment for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.', '', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal', '', 'Anxiety symptoms commonly occur in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal.', 'Anxiety disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance/medication)', '', 'Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a primary anxiety disorder based on the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings for use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas primary anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder, such as atypical age at onset (e.g., onset of panic disorder after age 45 years) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack symptoms such as true vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder control, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a substance/medication-induced etiology. A primary anxiety disorder diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of an anxiety disorder.', 'Delirium', '', 'If panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.', 'Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition', '', 'If the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medication is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not attributable to either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated.', '', '']
