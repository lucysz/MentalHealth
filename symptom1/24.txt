Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter “Assessment Measures.”)', '', '    Note: Diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made without using this severity specifier.', '', 'For additional information on Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis, Development and Course (age-related factors), Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues, Differential Diagnosis, and Comorbidity, see the corresponding sections in schizophrenia.', '', 'The characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizophrenia (Criterion A). Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished by its difference in duration: the total duration of the illness, including prodromal, active, and residual phases, is at least 1 month but less than 6 months (Criterion B). The duration requirement for schizophreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months. The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions: 1) when an episode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months and the individual has already recovered, and 2) when an individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months’ duration required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the diagnosis should be noted as “schizophreniform disorder (provisional)” because it is uncertain if the individual will recover from the disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance persists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia.', '', 'Another distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of a criterion requiring impaired social and occupational functioning. While such impairments may potentially be present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.', 'In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.', 'As with schizophrenia, currently there are no laboratory or psychometric tests for schizophreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions where neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neurophysiological research has indicated abnormalities, but none are diagnostic(Minzenberg et al. 2009; Ragland et al. 2009).', 'Incidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural settings is likely similar to that observed in schizophrenia (Naz et al. 2003). In the United States and other developed countries, the incidence is low, possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia (Baldwin et al. 2005; Bromet et al. 2011). In developing countries, the incidence may be higher, especially for the specifier “with good prognostic features”; in some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia.', 'The development of schizophreniform disorder is similar to that of schizophrenia. About one-third of individuals with an initial diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder (provisional) recover within the 6-month period and schizophreniform disorder is their final diagnosis(Naz et al. 2003). The majority of the remaining two-thirds of individuals will eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (Bromet et al. 2011).', 'Relatives of individuals with schizophreniform disorder have an increased risk for schizophrenia (Kendler and Walsh 1995). ', 'For the majority of individuals with schizophreniform disorder who eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the functional consequences are similar to the consequences of those disorders. Most individuals experience dysfunction in several areas of daily functioning, such as school or work, interpersonal relationships, and self-care. Individuals who recover from schizophreniform disorder have better functional outcomes. ', 'A wide variety of mental and medical conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. These include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or its treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder; substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or delirium; depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features; schizoaffective disorder; other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder; depressive or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophrenia; brief psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorders; autism spectrum disorder; disorders presenting in childhood with disorganized speech; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury.', '', 'Since the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia differ primarily in duration of illness, the discussion of the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia also applies to schizophreniform disorder.', 'Schizophreniform disorder differs in duration from brief psychotic disorder, which has a duration of less than 1 month.', '']
